With more than 15 years in the IT sector, I have built my expertise around the following three key pillars: java development, data and education. As a coach and lifelong learner, I have a natural curiosity to understand the challenges and create better solutions. Following this mindset, I have recently finished Magna Cum Laude the Postgraduate in Big Data and Analytics in Business at KU Leuven, pursuing a better understanding of the challenges faced in the sector.  

I joined Design is Dead convinced of its values and its strong technical knowledge in house. Both have led me to become an excellent AEM and full-stack developer with leadership skills obtaining a high satisfaction level of the business stakeholders.  

As Agile believer, I firmly believe that communication is vital for our profiles which should own not only the technical part of the delivery but the understanding of the business goal. My commitment to the Toastmaster association, where we work on communication skills, is proof of this mindset.
