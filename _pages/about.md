After spending more than a decade at the tutorial services of the engineering faculty of KU Leuven and a short-lived career in supplychain, I returned to my first love - software development.

The main challenge is keeping up-to-date. Nowadays, you have a framework of the month and a programming flavor of the week. With my academic background, I have developed skills and workflows to learn new technologies quite fast while keeping the overview. When I need to go more in depth, I know where to look.

Right now I'm a full-stack Java developer at [Design is Dead](http://www.designisdead.Com). One of their goals is to keep their employees on their toes - they challenged me after one month to get certified as an [Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experiencecloud/aem.html) developer before the end of the year. So I had only 4 weeks to brush up my development skills and get the AEM mindset. A few months ago, I set my mind on the AEM DevOps certificate. After working hard after hours and in weekends, I passed the exam and I am now the proud owner of 2 AEM certificates.
