After spending more than a decade at the tutorial services of the engineering faculty of KU Leuven and a short-lived career in supplychain, I returned to my first love - software development.

The main challenge is keeping up-to-date. Nowadays, you have a framework of the month and a programming flavor of the week. With my academic background, I have developed skills and workflows to learn new technologies quite fast while keeping the overview. When I need to go more in depth, I know where to look.

Right now I'm a full-stack Java developer at [Design is Dead](http://www.designisdead.Com). One of their goals is to keep their employees on their toes and allow every single developer to grow and succeed.

The past year, I joined the development team of a major yellow Belgian telco. As a senior developer, I do technical analysis, gain expert knowledge on key applications and help out collegues where needed.
