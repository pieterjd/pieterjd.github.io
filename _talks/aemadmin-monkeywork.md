Manual actions are mindnumbing for developers all over the world. On top of that, developers want to automate about everything.

AEMAdmin started out of frustration of having to delete several nodes in the repository manually after every deploy on my localbox. I wanted an error-free 1-click operation. So I defined the steps just once and let the program run over and over again.

In the meantime, it kept on growing and it now is a fullblown library with all kind of actions for property, node and page manipulations, querying, and so on. All commands follow the same structure and when testing is finished, you can point it to a different environment to execute the same tasks in the same order.

In this talk, I'll tell about the story how it came to be and how real-life challenges made the project grow. So expect a lot of live action and maybe some deja-vus.
