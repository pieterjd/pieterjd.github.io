It is the number one deployed module for drupal 7 and it will be available in core for drupal 8. Off course, I'm talking about views!

As it is a very valuable tool that makes everyone's life easier, you need to attend this session. I will walk you through views and cover following topics starting by a simple listing, over relationships, and filters - the whole shebang!

* A simple user directory
* Order the users the way you want
* Filter out unwanted users
* Make your listing searchable
* bring in related content and information
* And if there is some additional time, some advanced techniques

This session will mainly focus on demos and I will show you how you can try things out yourself with just a browser! In order to get the most out of the session, knowledge of the concepts of SQL is advised (selecting, filtering, aggregating/grouping, joining 2 or more tables).
