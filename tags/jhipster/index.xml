As it is one of the most popular icon sets, it is included with JHipster.
Out of the box, only some icons are available for your angular front-end. And it&amp;rsquo;s a bit tricky to find out how these icons are loaded as all Angular components use the fa-icon directive, available in JHipster.
In this particular use-case, I need to add the shopping basket icon.</description></item><item><title>I18N with JHipster</title><link>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/2019-01-15-i18n-with-jhipster/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:24:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/2019-01-15-i18n-with-jhipster/</guid><description>I myself am a huge fan of generators - it saves a lot of time. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love JHipster. JHipster not only uses my favourite frameworks such as Spring Boot and Angular, but it provides you with useful features out-of-the-box.
One of the questions of the wizard guiding you through the generation of your application, is which languages you want to support. For every selected language, all possible labels are generated.</description></item></channel></rss>
