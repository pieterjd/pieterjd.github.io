As a page is cached on the first render, this means that content is no longer dynamic as it always shows the information of the authenticated user at the time of caching.
Possible Solutions The dispatcher support authentication, however we were dealing with authentication that was not integrated into AEM.
Listing all the pages that contains this component and exclude them from caching by the dispatcher is also not the way the go because you then need an exhaustive list of pages containing this component.</description></item></channel></rss>
