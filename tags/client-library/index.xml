Unfortunatly this broke the build on Adobe Cloud. How did we solve this?
What&amp;rsquo;s the problem? Minification! From our client, we received already minified javascript and styling we needed to integrate in the AEM website. Nothing too difficult, but the build on AEM Cloud finished with errors. On top of that, we could not download the logs, so we really were in the dark here.</description></item></channel></rss>
