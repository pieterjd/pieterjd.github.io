Doing the same over and over again, but only few parts change each iteration.
Environment Variables While working on integrating an API, I had to authenticate with a Bearer token in the authentication header. These tokens are typically short-lived, so they change multiple times a day.
As part of the integration, I write down the API calls in Typora, a very nice markdown editor.</description></item><item><title>Automate AEM development</title><link>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-aem-development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2021 19:31:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-aem-development/</guid><description>When working with AEM, you&amp;rsquo;re confronted with tedious work - writing components with dialogs defined in XML, lots of boiler-plating. Ideal for automation!
Enter your favorite code generator Yeoman, &amp;ldquo;the Web&amp;rsquo;s Scaffolding ToolFor Modern Webapps&amp;rdquo; is great for this purpose. I came to know this when working on some JHipster project.
It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to define generator (eg. generate an AEM component) using templates (renderscript, dialog, &amp;hellip;.)
I&amp;rsquo;ve put things together in the AEM Generator Repo.</description></item><item><title>Automate Angular Material Workflow using Schematics</title><link>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-angular-material-workflow-with-schematics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 12:22:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-angular-material-workflow-with-schematics/</guid><description>What is this post about? I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of the SpringBoot backend - Angular frontend combination. And since my UX/UI skills are very limited, I really enjoy working with angular material, a really nice library of common widgets implemented as Angular components using the material design.
I found myself doing the same thing over and over again:
generate a table component, using the material table schematic create a service with Angular CLI connecting to a SpringBoot backend to retrieve objects, using the typical CRUD methods (getAll, save, delete, &amp;hellip;) create an interface matching the json obtained from the backend Then I suddenly realized:</description></item><item><title>Automate Timesheeting</title><link>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-timesheeting/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2020 20:54:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/automate-timesheeting/</guid><description>With every job come boring tasks. Number one, by far, is filling out timesheets. And if you are unlucky, as I was in case of the yellow telco, you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with an old dud.
What old dud? I&amp;rsquo;m talking about fusion by Oracle. It has a horrible interface - even entering a single digit is annoying. On top of that, it was an exotic, buggy, beta version - no one wanted to touch it , including Oracle.</description></item></channel></rss>
