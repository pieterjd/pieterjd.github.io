<h2 id=getting-my-hands-dirty>Getting my hands dirty<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#getting-my-hands-dirty>#</a></h2>
<p>I basically followed the quickstart instructions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install hugo using brew</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the new site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a theme - I chose the hermit theme as it&rsquo;s complete and fits my needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Import the jekyll post using the <a href=https://gohugo.io/commands/hugo_import_jekyll/#hugo-import-jekyll><code>hugo import jekyll</code></a> command. The blog posts were wrongly copied in the <code>post</code> folder instead of the <code>posts</code> folder.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>import</code> command didn&rsquo;t import all content: my talks and pages weren&rsquo;t copied. I had to manually create the <code>talks</code> folder and the folders for the static pages such as the about page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On some pages I used css(<a href=https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/2019-11-11-colors-for-presentations/>colors for presentation</a> post) and javascript(linkedin badge on the <a href=/about>about</a> page). This wasn&rsquo;t rendered as both css and js in markdown is considered as a security issue. This was fixed by setting the unsafe <code>propety</code> of <code>[markup.goldmark.renderer]</code> to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>In short, a theme provides a layouts. An overview of posts, talks, &mldr; is rendered using the list layout usually located at <code>themes/&lt;themename>/layouts/_default</code>.
