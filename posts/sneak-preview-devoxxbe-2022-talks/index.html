Yes you can!   Shaun Smith  Tools-in-Action | Java   Containers are increasing the way Java applications are packaged and deployed. There are lots of qualities desirable in a containerized application like fast startup and low memory and CPU requirements, but size and security are also important considerations. Moving big container images around a network will increase the time it takes to start up a new K8s pod or launch a container, and \"just enough operating system\" container images with reduced attack surface area are also preferable. So what’s the smallest possible Java container image? In this session we’ll demonstrate how to build containerized Java applications small as a mere 1.5MB! Using GraalVM Native Image ahead-of-time compilation and static linking with musl libc we can shrink down and strip out all the unnecessary bits that bloat a typical Java apps and deploy them in lightweight and security focused container images like Alpine and distroless–even scratch!\n   Ahead Of Time and Native in Spring Boot 3.0   Stéphane Nicoll and Brian Clozel  Conference | Server Side Java   Ahead Of Time and Native is a major topic for the upcoming Spring major releases. With this talk, you’ll get a complete tour of the AOT efforts and a glimpse at Spring Boot 3.0.\nAfter a successful experimental phase with the Spring Native project, the Spring team is bringing Ahead Of Time (AOT) support to Spring. The goal here is to enable GraalVM native use cases and improve JVM efficiency.\n\nDuring this talk, Stéphane and Brian will discuss the state of the AOT theme in the latest milestones of Spring Framework 6.0 and Spring Boot 3.0:\n\nThe design of the AOT engineHow this new infrastructure can be used by librariesWhat to expect as an application developer   Akka Streams for the Brave   Daniel Ciocirlan  Conference | Architecture   Akka Streams is one of the most powerful libraries for streaming computation. In this talk, we'll learn how we can leverage the expressiveness of the Akka Streams DSL to write in 20 lines what other engineers take 2000 to even think about it.\n\nWe’ll cover the principles of Reactive Streams and show, in live code, how they work with Akka Streams. We will start by discussing what Akka Streams is made of, how components are tied together and how they function, and how we can design complex graphs of components with its concise and powerful DSL. At the end we will finish up with a recursive stream generating interesting values by itself.\n   An Introduction To Residuality Theory   Barry O’Reilly  Conference | Architecture   Residuality theory is a revolutionary new theory of software design that aims to make it easier to design software systems for complex business environments. Residuality theory models software systems as interconnected residues - an alternative to component and process modeling that uses applied complexity science to make managing uncertainty a fundamental part of the design process.\n   Apache Maven BoF   Maarten Mulders,Hervé Boutemy and Karl Heinz Marbaise  BOF | Build \u0026 Deploy   A lot of things are moving in Maven’s world. In this BoF, we welcome everybody involved with Maven to discuss. It doesn't matter if you're a user, a contributor or a committer, just join us.\n   A postgres-compatible DB on Kubernetes: YugabyteDB   Franck Pachot  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   Let’s install YugabyteDB, an open-source PostgreSQL compatible database on Kubernetes. And explain the reasons for it: distribute data to many active nodes, sharded and replicated, in sync, to the region’s data centers for high availability, or geo-distributed to reduce latency for worldwide users. Today, this is possible with distributed SQL databases, bringing powerful SQL and ACID features to the same scalability as the NoSQL datastores.\n   Apps modernization strategy: a light at the end of the tunnel   Karina Varela  Conference | Architecture   Think of that one legacy service in production. Well, you've just been asked to add new functionalities to it. You can already predict the pain in this modernization:\ncode changes are ineffective and error-prone, and rewriting may ask for insane amounts of work; you can't move it to cloud environments due to high predictable costs; if creating new services, you must overcome the challenges of handling data in distributed systems (e.g., dual-write, eventual consistency, distributed transactions) \nLuckily, you can join this talk and see the way out! \n\nIn this session, we'll explore a modernization strategy with the outbox pattern. Event-driven technologies and cloud adoption boosts this architecture's solution through enterprise data integration patterns - consequently opening new possibilities for your use cases deliveries.\n\nLet's run through an actual implementation to learn how change data capture (CDC) allows extending apps by immersing them - with zero code changes- within a cloud-based event-driven microservice architecture. This CDC on steroids relies on cloud-native technologies like Kafka, Kafka Streams, Quarkus, Camel, and OpenShift.\n\nBest of all: You can leave this session with extra architectural knowledge, a complete architectural technical guide, a step-by-step guide to trying the solution and getting your hands dirty, and finally, feeling confident to apply it in your context when needed. \n\nIt's time to gear up and extend your existing tech stack!\n   Architecture Katas : Improve your system architecture design skills in a funny way !   Alexandre Touret  Quickie | Architecture   How to learn architecture ? How to improve in this field ? How do we recognize a good or a bad architecture ?\nThere are plenty of books and training sessions about this subject. The best thing is to practice!\nIn the same way as coding dojos, I will present to you architecture katas. There are created by Ted Neward (http://blogs.tedneward.com/). His idea came from the following observation :\n\"So how are we supposed to get great architects, if they only get the chance to architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?\"\nOne solution to this issue could be to practice regularly on several topics to gain experience.\nAfter a brief introduction of how to start designing an architecture, I will present architecture katas, and the conduct. \nTo conclude, after this first try I will present the benefits I had benefited.\n   Artificial Intelligence: You Are Here   Alan D. Thompson  Keynote | Data \u0026 AI   2022 has brought about an explosion in the world of artificial intelligence. Some have described the current AI trajectory as a shift more profound than the discovery of fire, or the birth of the internet. Google's Transformer architecture—introduced just a few years ago—has permanently changed the landscape, giving rise to hundreds of new AI models around the world, from Abu Dhabi to Switzerland. \nThe capabilities of these models are only limited by human imagination, as they generate new code, conceptualize images from scratch, write books, control robots, and much more. Discover the latest models and frameworks beyond GPT-3, from Meta NLLB to Google Pathways. \nSee popular AI applications and use cases. And understand what all of this means for the future of artificial general intelligence, and you.\n   Attracting and retaining women in tech: going beyond the trend !   Marcy Ericka Charollois  Conference | People \u0026 Culture   Women are underrepresented in the digital realm. Today, they represent only 28 to 30% of employees, all professions combined.\n\nWhat happened in this professional sector, however dominated by women during its genesis? Would women no longer feel in their place or not?\n\nSome disturbing findings:\n\n.higher education leading to digital technology is invested in by men; .recruitment advertisements are not, as a rule, thought and written for women; .tech teams don't think about the deep needs of women or diversity; .women do not feel heard.\n\nEven if women communicate, it seems that we do not listen to them. And what are the results? Migration to corollary professions, brown-out, disembodiment in the team, resignations, creation of FemTech.\nOn a diverse spectrum, they lead the creation of safe places as a room of community expression.\n\nSo, if you want to promote diversity beyond the trend, and you have understood that the helping women in tech is a breach in solving the issue of diversity and inclusion, take part in my talk!\n   Belgian JVM Lovers Unite: The User Groups need you!   Renato Cavalcanti,Olivier Hubaut and Tom Cools  BOF | People \u0026 Culture   It’s crystal clear that the JVM-world is better place when we build, learn and discover things together. User Groups are great places to connect with other JVM lovers, share knowledge and have some nerdy fun… but they are nothing without you!\nWe invite everyone with an interest in the JVM community experience in Belgium to an open discussionon the present and future of JVM related User Groups. You don't have to be a community leader or Java Champion to contribute, everyone is welcome to share their amazing ideas, hopeful wishes and daring dreams!\nUser Groups are a valuable part of our ecosystem and they get even better when we work together. So now it's time to unite and make Belgium an even better place for JVM-lovers!\n   Blinking a LED with JBang and Pi4J on a Raspberry Pi in 15 minutes   Frank Delporte  Quickie | Mind the Geek   Ever wanted to experiment with electronic components combined with software? With Java, a Raspberry Pi, and Pi4J you can! \nIn this short session, we will go from zero to hero and control a LED with a single class to interact with a LED (and more?) that is connected to one of the magic pins of a Raspberry Pi. \nBy using JBang we don't even need to install Java, Maven, or any other tool. JBang and a text editor are all we need to create an application that can interact with the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins of the Raspberry Pi to control components, read states, handle events, etc.\n   Browser security and HTTP Headers : Attacks and protections in action !    Mathieu Humbert  Conference | Security   HTTP security headers play a critical role in securing browsers from numerous attacks : CSRF, XSS and more recently XS-Leaks to name a few. We can mitigate them if we leverage headers like CSP, HSTS, COxP or even CORS.\n\nIn these session, I'll demonstrate how easy it is to exploit client-side vulnerabilities and talk about the HTTP Headers that could mitigate them and better secure our browsers.\n\nSo let's play ! 😈😇\n   Build and deploy cloud native Java microservices on Kubernetes with Istio service mesh   Deepu K Sasidharan  Deep Dive | Build \u0026 Deploy   Istio is one of the most popular services mesh solutions available these days. In this deep dive session, let us see how to build and deploy Java microservices to the cloud using Istio, Kubernetes, JHipster, and Spring Cloud.\nIstio moves the responsibility of service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, monitoring, etc from the application to the platform(Kubernetes) thus letting the developers focus on the business code. But setting it up could be a daunting task for beginners and pros alike. In this session, we will take a deep dive into how Istio works and will learn how to use different features of istio, like load balancing, canary deployments, A/B testing, and so on.\n\nWhat you will learn:\nWhat is a service mesh, how does Istio work, and what features does it offerHow to build Java microservices quickly using JHipsterHow to add Istio support to your Java microservicesSetup Istio on a Kubernetes installation (for example on Google Cloud)Setup observability and monitoring for the Kubernetes + Istio clusterDeploy microservices to KubernetesHow to use different Istio features like load balancing, canary deployments, A/B testing, routing, and traffic splitsSecurity options for Java + Spring + Istio   Build Better, Deploy Faster: Spring Boot + Spring Cloud in the Cloud for frictionless Kubernetes-based Microservices   Mark Heckler  Deep Dive | Server Side Java   In this session, you'll learn how to leverage proven patterns \u0026 open source software to rapidly build a robust portfolio of microservices that provide a solid foundation for your dynamic and growing microservice architecture, then learn how to make the cloud do it for you so you can focus on your customers' needs. This session addresses vital points such as:\n\n+ Configuration services\n+ Microservice registration and discovery\n+ Features for system resilience\n+ Intelligent routing\n+ Secure secret keeping\n\nAnd more, depending on time available\n\nThe presenter will demonstrate how to develop, deploy, and manage microservices with tools employed by industry leaders to build resilient, scalable, \u0026 available systems using Spring Cloud and Azure, but all concepts and constructs shown apply to various frameworks and cloud platforms.\n   Building multi-screen experiences for the mobile web   Yohan Lasorsa and Olivier Leplus  Tools-in-Action | UI \u0026 UX   You've probably seen these new smartphones with foldable screens, like the Samsung Galaxy Fold, or with two screens like the Surface Duo. They're already on the market, so it's up to you to update and rethink your web apps for these devices! But how? Where to start? Fortunately, the web is constantly evolving and has already started adapting for these new devices, thanks to new APIs.\nIn this talk, we'll explore why and how leveraging multiple screens can help you create new user experiences for your web apps, by diving into new and experimental web features. We'll also have a look at how we can adapt existing apps for these new devices while trying to avoid dealing with the quirkiness of these new CSS and JavaScript primitives.\n   Building Reusable Server Components in React 18   William Bishop and Addison Schultz  Hands-on Lab | UI \u0026 UX   React 18 just launched earlier this year, with a feature React developers have been looking forward to for a long time: Server Components. In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of what React Server Components are, how to effectively build and use them, while focusing on one of the major advantages of React: Reusability through components. Join Addison and Will from Miro to see how you can get ahead of the curve and start building reusable server components for your next project.\n   Building Smart Devices using Java on the RaspberryPi - An intro to Pi4J.   Frank Delporte  Conference | Mind the Geek   A Raspberry Pi is a full Linux PC with a small form factor and a low price of between 6 and 95€. And of course, you can run Java on it. The same kind of JVM applications you know, love, and use on heavy machines can also be used on the Raspberry Pi. \"Write once, run everywhere\"? Ah yes, that's the promise of Java! But this small board has some additional possibilities you will not find on that fancy server you are running somewhere in the cloud.\n\nDo you need a touch-screen device to interact with your home automation or a machine? JavaFX, the new Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (15€), and a touchscreen are the perfect and affordable combo to provide the perfect solution. Yes, with its low price but high specifications, Raspberry Pi is opening whole new worlds.\n\nAnd on top of that, all Raspberry Pis have those 40 magical pins to connect an unlimited choice of electronic components. Measuring temperatures and distances, toggling LEDs and relays, controlling the content on a LED matrix or LCD display, playing the Star Wars tune on a buzzer,... the only limit is your imagination! In this talk, we'll take a look at the current state of Pi4J (www.pi4j.com) and dive into the code of a few of these example use-cases. Let's experiment with Java on a CrowPi - a Raspberry Pi-based laptop - to read values from sensors and control other electronic components, and show the values on a JavaFX dashboard.\n   Caching beyond simple put and gets   Jakub Marchwicki  Tools-in-Action | Architecture   First things first: when there is caching in the talk title, the famous quote from Phil Karlton must follow. So let's get this one out of the way: there are only two hard things in Computer Science - cache invalidation and naming things. \nYes, caching is hard. It looks simple at first glance, which leads to a simplistic design and implementation. The application starts slowing down: introduce some caches. Simple library, simply put, a few gets, simple invalidation logic (or maybe not). Fast forward, and we end up with even worse bottlenecks. Instead of fixing an issue, we've just covered it with yet another layer of mud: stalled data (already invalid) in services which cannot be scaled out (different data lands on different nodes) and traded latency and read-access time for risk of actually losing the data (eventual writes). \nWe obviously can do better! In this talk, we will walk through different use-cases (as cache design depends on the use-case) which might require caching. We will look at how caching can be designed and effectively implemented. For the sake of time and fast feedback look, the examples will run on top of Hazelcast managed service.\n   Clean Code with Records, Sealed Classes and Pattern Matching   José Paumard  Conference | Java   The releases of the JDK 17 to 19 bring interesting features in the Java language: sealed types, pattern matching for switch (as a preview feature). Along with the introduction of records, the implementation of pattern matching in the Java language begins to take shape. The JDK 19 brings even more with Record pattern matching (as a preview feature), that further simplifies your code. In this presentation we show you how records are working, how you can use them to make your code much more readable, and how you can leverage sealed types and switch expressions to improve the modularity of your application. You will see pattern matching in action on real examples, how it will change the way you write Java code, and what you can expect on this topic in the future. It is mostly a live coding presentation, with some slides when the code shown cannot be executed.\n   Cloud-native for beginners: Istio 0 to 60   Eitan Suez  Hands-on Lab | Build \u0026 Deploy   Experience the Istio service mesh through hands-on exercises. In this tutorial, you’ll get up to speed with the most popular and most-used service mesh in production - Istio. \n\nWe’ll explain what a service mesh is and what makes it work (hint: it’s Envoy!). After the brief theoretical introduction, we’ll jump into practice, where you’ll learn how to install Istio, route traffic between different service versions, configure mutual TLS, and use observability tools such as Grafana, Kiali, and Zipkin.\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you’ll understand how Istio works and how to use Istio’s custom resource definitions to bend the mesh to fit your scenarios.\n   Co-creating with UX and Software   Simone de Gijt and Thamar Swart  Conference | People \u0026 Culture   What would happen if we would bring design, front end, back end etc. all together? How could we improve the user-flows by thinking of alternative, non-happy flows? What would happen to the performance and therefore the user-experience when back end is already involved before the finalised wireframes are handed over?! \n\nThat's all nice and dandy. But we do need to deal with some concerns like:\n- Knowledge gap: How can the different disciplines with their specialty understand each other and come to conclusions?\n- Shared responsibilities: Where do start and where do they end?\n- Efficiency: What would it do to the efficiency of the team when they get different tasks?\n\nIn this session we’ll dive in together;\n- seeing what the pro's and con's are of a multidisciplinaire way of working,\n- what tips and tricks can be exchanged,\n- and what kind of tools can help in smoothing out the concerns that arise    Code Your First Video Game AI   Mathis Hammel  Hands-on Lab | Mind the Geek   Have you ever wondered what it’s like to create an artificial intelligence for a video game?\n\nIn this workshop, you will learn and apply the main techniques used in the game industry to implement smart agents, such as the minimax algorithm or finite-state machines. There will also be a challenge where your AI can compete against others, and participants can win small prizes!\n\nYou can follow the workshop in almost any language, but Java/C++/Python/JavaScript are recommended.\n   Confessions of a Rusty Java developer   Alex Snaps  Conference | Mind the Geek   Rust has been picking up momentum over the last few years. It started with being more prevalent in system programming or when targeting WebAssembly. But now in the meantime it has a vibrant ecosystem for asynchronous server-side programming, whether REST API, gRPC and other… Let’s you safely share code across other languages. Not to mention, the most loved programming language on Stack Overflow!\nBut why? What does it bring to the table that you might care about? Java addresses many of your current needs, so why even bother? The language is constantly evolving, such as with records, sealed classes and pattern matching…\nIn this session we will go through how Rust is different from Java and what it means. This will be a gentle introduction to a language that can be scary at times, because of its compiler error messages, showcasing some of its incredibly powerful features. We’ll see how these enable the use of development patterns when using common data-structures, such as a Map or a List. We’ll also look into the toolchain and all the new target platforms that become available when writing Rust. Rust is here to stay… and so is Java. Yet there is lot to learn from looking into the approaches Rust took, that will benefit you as a Java developer with its features to come. And how you can get your Rust code to run on a microcontroller, where a JVM would not run…\n   Container Queries: The next step towards a truly modular CSS   Maarten Van Hoof  Tools-in-Action | UI \u0026 UX   Modular, componentized frameworks and libraries are more popular than ever, but currently screen size is the only dimensional constraint to which a web design can adapt to. Luckily for us, great things are a foot.\n\nContainer Queries, which allow you to style elements based on their ancestors dimensions, a feature requested by many since the advent of component-based front-end architectures met the principles of responsive webdesign, is finally in active development.\n\nIn this talk, Maarten will explain what Container Queries are and show you how each component can adapt its design to the dimensions of its container. Join us on our journey towards a more modular CSS.\n   Cucumber tests: legends and reality   Michaël Strauss  Quickie | Development Practices   Writing tests, a required activity not always that fun. So, when some framework seem to enable writing them in natural langage, easily and quickly, user's (and manager's) expectations are skyrocketing !\n\nBut what is it really about ?\n   Das Boot: Diving into Debugging Spring Boot Applications   Mark Heckler  Conference | Server Side Java   Spring Boot streamlines Java and Kotlin development with its developer-first focus. By simplifying dependency management and deployment, providing unmatched autoconfiguration capabilities, and leveraging convention over configuration at every opportunity, developers can focus nearly all of their efforts on designing, developing, and delivering amazing software. This is the happy path, and it is wide.\n\nGood developers write good code, but great developers can diagnose the inevitable issues that arise in complex software systems. When your code takes the road less traveled, how can you quickly identify, isolate, and resolve the problem, not the symptoms? How can you move from good to great?\n\nIn this session, the presenter will take you on a live-coding adventure(TM) into the hidden passageways of your Spring Boot application. Topics covered may include (but are not limited to) the following, depending upon time available:\n\nApplication startup, including autoconfiguration steps/processBean initialization and configurationDebugging local apps via IDERemote debugging container applicationsTracing distributed appsDebugging reactive code\nCome to this session to get a deeper understanding of your Spring Boot apps and level up your debugging skills!\n   Data At Scale - 10 pitfalls holding you back bringing value from data at scale   Yoann Benoit  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   Rare are the companies that don't exploit their data today, but also rare are those that have succeeded in scaling up its use and putting data at the heart of their activity.\n\nWe are now entering the era of Data At Scale: the first successes of data projects and products are arriving and lessons have been learned from the mistakes made. The wish is now to go to the next level: promote the launch of tens or hundreds of data use cases in parallel. In other words : being Data Centric.\n\nExcept that this next level is a path strewn with pitfalls, it is a profound change that must be carried out, both organizationally, technologically and methodologically speaking.\n\nIn this talk, we'll present you 10 pitfalls to avoid in order to make this scaling up a success. From strategic organization to team sizing and good data product development practices, each component will have its share of potential errors. You may recognize yourself in some, and be able to anticipate and be proactive for others. \nLet's find out !\n   Debugging distributed systems   Bert Jan Schrijver  Conference | Development Practices   Nowadays, most software projects are distributed systems: components are located on different networked computers which communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. Debugging distributed systems is not easy. When two components don’t play nice together, the cause could be virtually anything: software, DNS, routing, firewalls, proxies, load balancers, TLS.. and more!\nIn this talk, I’ll share my experience with debugging distributed systems. We’ll look at typical issues and share ways to debug those issues and find their root causes. We’ll dive into networking, infrastructure, logging/tracing/metrics, testing, remote debugging and more. I’ll share lots of examples and war stories along the way. After this talk, you’ll have practical knowledge on how and where to get started with debugging distributed systems yourself!\n   Demystifying JWT   Sanchit Khurana  Quickie | Security   Auth is one of the most crucial parts of any web application. Getting the auth correctly set up is a daunting task, but this talk will help you in understand the power of JSON Web Tokens or JWTs for short, and the problem it solves while also shedding light on the 5 common pitfalls.\n\n\n   Deserialization exploits in Java: why should I care?   Brian Vermeer  Conference | Security   Hackers refer to deserialization in Java as “the gift that keeps on giving”. But what is actually the problem? In most cases, it is not even your own code that creates this security vulnerability. This problem is also not restricted to Java’s custom serialization framework. When deserializing JSON, XML, or YAML, similar issues can occur as well. In this talk, I explain how deserialization vulnerabilities work natively in Java and how attack chains are created. Next, I will show that deserializing XML, JSON, and YAML can also get you into trouble. And of course, we had the recent Log4j problems with deserialization. Many different problems can occur when deserializing data and in this session, I will use several demos to illustrate various security issues. How do you avoid these issues? I will give you some pointers on how to mitigate these problems in your own applications, this also includes new features in Java 17. At the end of this session, you will have an understanding of the problem space and be able to take action in your code to prevent it.\n   Docker Compose: From Localhost to Cloud   Guillaume Lours and Antonio Goncalves  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   You know Docker, right? But do you know Docker Compose? Yes? But do you know what’s new in the 2.0 release? And do you know that you can use Docker Compose in your development environment as well as in production? No? Then, this talk is for you.\n\nIn this talk we will quickly present the history behind Docker Compose, and highlight some of the novelties brought by Docker Compose 2.0. We will show you some advanced use cases that you might use as a developer on your local machine. But did you know that Ops can also take advantage of Docker Compose by deploying an entire application to the Cloud? Yes, in a single command an entire application can be deployed to your Could provider without the need of Kubernetes. And talking a K8s, we will end our talk by giving you some hints on when to use Docker Compose over K8s.\n\n\n   Docker Who: Small Containers Through Time and Space   Dmitry Chuyko  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   Have you recently moved to microservices? Your team is deploying the code much faster, but data transfer costs are going up as well, aren’t they? That’s because the size of containers matters the most, and keeping them lightweight means saving on bandwidth usage.\nBellSoft’s engineers have come up with a solution, which is full-fledged Alpine Linux support in OpenJDK. By that, we’ve also invented a real-life TARDIS: Containers that take only a few MB of storage but carry enormous potential. With the release of JDK 16, the Portola Project has been integrated into the OpenJDK mainline as part of our JEP 386. Duct-taping with a glibc layer will become a thing of the past, as all the processes will connect flawlessly. Your company will get to use tiny container images independently of the distribution kit vendor. They have been available for a long time, but the official HotSpot port status for the musl library will expand the scope and simplify related development.\nMy talk is going to touch upon the benefits that Alpine Linux is bringing to the OpenJDK community. It will also explain how to optimize Docker images for free by changing just one or two lines of code. Lastly, I’ll offer a tool for choosing an optimal container that will suit your project perfectly.\n   Dungeons, Dragons, and Graph Databases   Guy Royse  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   Are you an adventurer? Do you want gold? Experience? Levels? Of course you do! And where do you get these things? The dungeon, where else? But, unfortunately, dungeons aren't setup for the convenience of adventurers who wish to extract these fine things. You have to wander about and get what you get.\n\nBut you’re also a developer. You could build a database of all the rooms with their content. Then you could query it and find the best route to get the gold and the experience and the levels. But how would you model this data and write these queries? The rooms. The corridors. The monsters. The sparkling hoozits. That’s a lot of entities to relate to each other. And that’s gonna be a monster of a SQL query. Whoa–look at that JOIN! Better get my text editor ready.\n\nOr, you could use a graph database. A graph database allows you to model these relationships intuitively with nodes and edges. Being schema-free, you can evolve your graph as you encounter new things such as traps or secret doors. And, using the Cypher query language, you can write elegant and easy to understand queries that find the best routes to get the stuff adventures desire most.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll introduce you to the concepts of graph databases and compare how to solve this problem with a relational database and how a graph database makes it easier.\n\nSo come, have a flagon of mead as you learn about graph databases, optimize your dungeon crawl, and equip another weapon in your quest for better software!\n   Dynamic workflow orchestration with Apache Airflow and CrateDB   Marija Selakovic  Tools-in-Action | Data \u0026 AI   With the rise of complex data solutions, the need for automating and orchestrating database processes is becoming increasingly important: there are more and more use cases when a database change requires a chain of operations where the execution of an operation depends on the execution of previous ones. Furthermore, to quickly develop and adapt database orchestrations, one must use the tools that offer scalable solutions that are easy to monitor and manage.\nThis talk will illustrate how easy it is to automate orchestration workflows with Apache Airflow and CrateDB. Apache Airflow is one of the most popular platforms for programmatically creating, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The workflows are defined as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where each node in a DAG represents an execution task. Initially, Airflow was designed in a way that each task run independently. As of Airflow 2.3, a dynamic task mapping feature has been introduced, making Airflow a perfect solution for building dynamic workflows.\nOn the other hand, CrateDB is an open-source, distributed database that makes storage and analysis of massive amounts of data simple and efficient. CrateDB offers a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and availability. One of CrateDB’s key strengths is its compatibility with many data engineering tools, including Apache Airflow. In this talk, you will learn how to set up a new orchestration project, and how to use Airflow with CrateDB to orchestrate complex tasks.    Error 404: Color not found   Dennie Declercq  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   Colors are an important way to convey information, but there are a lot of people with color blindness and low vision. What if your only way of conveying information is using color? What about an infographic where the color contrast is too low and the information is not reaching the end user, the customer or co-worker? What about missing the deal of your life due to an inaccessible website? In some cases the error: ‘color not found’ will directly lead to: ‘customer or deal not found’. I guess this is not what we want our products to be!\n\nIn this talk I teach you about color contrast, color blindness and the use of color in UX. I also tell you about tools that you can use to test color accessibility in a lot of use cases.\n   Event-driven autoscaling for Serverless Java   Daniel Oh  Conference | Development Practices   Kubernetes makes it possible to autoscale various business use cases from the web apps to mobile, IoT edge streaming, and AI/ML in more reliable and stable ways. One caveat of the Kubernetes autoscaling is based on hardware resource utilization (CPU, memory) through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. This causes a new challenge to build an event-driven serverless Java on Kubernetes because the event metrics from multiple event sources (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS SQS) are more relevant than a pod's CPU usage for deciding when applications need to be scaled out and in. \nFortunately, KEDA and Knative on Kubernetes are designed to solve this challenge by autoscaling both standard apps and serverless by event metrics in a separate way. This session will teach you how to redesign your Kubernetes autoscaling architecture by event-driven metrics from Apache Kafka over standard resources (CPU, Memory) with Knative and KEDA integration for serverless Java using Quarkus.\n\n   Expect The Unexpected: How To Choose Reliable Open Source Dependencies   Theresa Mammarella and Kadi Grigg  Conference | Development Practices   Open source components make up a staggering 90% of modern application dependencies. Given the software industry’s heavy reliance on open source projects, it’s increasingly important to choose well-maintained, community-based components to withstand better an unpredictable disaster, such as last year's Log4j vulnerability.\n\nAs software security professionals that also happen to be pandemic brides, we know a thing or two about dealing with the unexpected. As it turns out, choosing reliable event vendors has a lot of parallels with choosing open source software components. Come to this talk to learn about best practices around choosing open source dependencies you can rely on and how to set your ecosystem up for success.\n\n\n   Fairies, Fakers and Factories: boost you tests with better test data   Jaap Coomans  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   Whether you write your tests up front or after the fact, you've probably found yourself in this situation: You know exactly what you want to test and how you're going to approach it, but you suffer from a massive lack of inspiration when you try to define your test data. Eventually you end up with \"Test User\", \"Jane Doe\" and \"Product123\". This is both frustrating and ineffective. Coming up with good test data over and over again can be mind numbing and the result is mostly not representative for the data that will actually flow through your system.\nSo how can you improve this? Is there a way you can easily generate good test data and at the same time reduce the burden of creating test data over and over again? Yes you can! In this session I will show you how you can use test data generators like Java Faker and jFairy to create test data factories that help you improve the quality of your test data. I will show how this can massively improve your productivity when writing tests, because it helps you to focus on what really matters: the tests themselves.\n   Fast and Furious Full-Stack Development with JHipster \u0026 Spring Native   Alina Yurenko  Quickie | Server Side Java   JHipster is a development platform thatmakes it easy and fun to build modern web and microservices with Spring Boot, Micronaut, and Quarkus, as well as Angular, React, and Vue. With the addition of Spring Native support, it's now possible to build applications that can be compiled ahead of time into self contained native platform executables using GraalVM Native Image. In this session we'll talk about how you can create such app from scratch, extend it, and see some demos!\n   from Java and Scala to assembly   Jarek Ratajski  Deep Dive | Java   When it comes to performance, many developers take for granted statements (myths) that are not always valid, no longer correct, or were never accurate.\nPerformance and benchmarking were always tough topics, and in languages such as java and scala, there are so many layers between code and machine that any analysis seems futile. We will, however, try to do this and check a few exciting examples of scala code snippets down to the \"bare metal\".\nWe will use recent JVM versions, including graal and some valuable tools such as\njitwatch, javap, gc logs, jmh, performance counters. The next time someone claims something about performance, you can measure and check it.\n   From Serverful to Serverless Java with AWS Lambda   Dennis Kieselhorst and Maximilian Schellhorn  Hands-on Lab | Server Side Java   For more than 25 years, Java played an essential role when building sustainable software architectures and applications. The traditional approach to develop \u0026 run Java applications included setting up applications servers, complex build \u0026 dependency management and often relied on large enterprise frameworks. In contrast, Serverless functions are ideally short-lived, single-purposed and do not rely on extensive infrastructure configuration. This paradigm shift encouraged new frameworks, concepts and techniques to evolve.\n\nIn this workshop you will learn how to bring your traditional Java Spring application to AWS Lambda with minimal effort and iteratively apply optimizations to get the best out of your Serverless Java experience. You will get an overview of best practices, performance trade-offs and the design considerations for each step to be able to make well-informed decisions when bringing enterprise Java applications to AWS Lambda.\n   Future of Frontend Development   Rainer Hahnekamp  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   For the last couple of years, React, Vue \u0026 Angular have positioned themselves as the \"Big 3\" frameworks for frontend development. They still add new features, but not at that rate compared to the early days. Did we already reach the peak?\nOn the contrary! Svelte's compiler approach, React's Server Components or esbuild's performance (via not using JavaScript) are groundbreaking changes that will shape the next generation. If the \"Big 3\" will adopt or vanish, is another topic...\nJoin my talk and see how these new approaches are expanding the frontiers even more.\n   Fuzzing in Go   Valentin Deleplace  Tools-in-Action | Security   The recent release of Go 1.18 brought not only the long-awaited generics, but also a new Fuzzing capability built in the standard toolchain.\n\nBut what is Fuzzing?\n\nLet's explore what Fuzzing is about, see how it's integrated in the testing framework to automate randomized testing, and write a live demo from scratch.\n\nFuzzing is not consistently used in the software industry yet, however Fuzzing has the potential to detect critical security flaws. More than ever, who can afford to neglect defence in depth, when exposing any service at all on the internet?\n   Game of Loom: implementation patterns and performance implications playing with virtual threads   Mario Fusco  Conference | Java   Virtual threads will be very likely the next big game changer in the Java ecosystem, allowing to have the scalability of asynchronous programming models with the simplicity of synchronous code. Their main claim is that, differently from native threads that are a costly and then scarce resource, you can create as many virtual threads as you want with known and much cheaper memory and performance impact than the native ones. But is this always true? What are the costs of scheduling thousands or even millions of virtual threads? Does the more frequent context switch have some performance implications? What about the cache misses that these context switches could potentially imply? During this talk we will try to answer these questions in a funny way, by analyzing an implementation of the traditional Conway's Game of Life based on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) model and using both virtual and native threads with different algorithms in order to compare their performances. Based on this analysis we will also try to derive some rules of thumb on when and how using virtual threads. \n   Google's Journey from Java to Kotlin for Server-Side Programming   James Ward,Brad Hawkes and John Pampuch  Conference | Server Side Java   Kotlin is now the recommended programming language for server-side JVM usage at Google, set to replace Java while still providing access to a large existing Java ecosystem. With over 8 million lines of Kotlin code at Google (across server and Android), we've done a number of things to ensure our developers are successful with Kotlin. This talk will explore the reasons we've switched from Java to Kotlin and how we've made it a successful change.\n   GraalVM Cloud Native \u0026 Micronaut® Deep Dive   Graeme Rocher  Deep Dive | Server Side Java   This session is for developers looking to go beyond the basics with Micronaut®, a microservices and serverless framework for Java, Kotlin, and Groovy.\n\nTaking an extensive look at how advanced features such as dependency injection (DI), aspect-oriented programming (AOP), and ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation work, the creator of the Micronaut framework, Graeme Rocher, will walk attendees through the Micronaut framework’s elegant programming model and how to rapidly build compelling Microservice applications.\n\nGraeme will also demonstrate how the Micronaut framework can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to produce fast, efficient and optimized Cloud Native Microservices that ensure maximum Cloud portability.\n\n\n   GraalVM Native Image Bootcamp   Kris Foster and Shaun Smith  Hands-on Lab | Java   What do Quarkus, Spring Native, Micronaut, and Helidon have in common? They all support GraalVM Native Image ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to transform applications into a native machine executables that starts almost instantaneously, provides peak performance with no warmup, and require less memory and less CPU. It's perfect for containerized workloads and microservices where maximizing startup time and minimizing required resources is critical. In this workshop we'll provide a practical introduction to GraalVM Native Image AOT covering how it works, what it can do, when to use it, and how to tune and debug applications.\nTopics include: building with Maven and Gradle, static and dynamic linking, containerization, configuration, working with resources, profile guided optimization, garbage collection options, and JUnit testing and debugging native executables\n\n   gRPC Cornerstone: HTTP/2… or HTTP/3?   Alex Borysov and Mykyta Protsenko  Conference | Server Side Java   Hiding all the underlying protocol complexity makes gRPC really popular. The framework makes all the decisions on how to layer an RPC model on top of HTTP/2. API designers and users are not exposed to low-level implementation details.\n\nOn the other hand, knowing these details may be necessary when troubleshooting and making performance optimizations in a real-life system. \n\nThis talk provides practical advice on triaging gRPC interactions and achieving performance improvements - by covering technical details, starting with HTTP/2 frames and streams in gRPC. It also exposes the limitations of HTTP/2 and prepares the audience for the upcoming HTTP/3 standard and its integration with gRPC.\n\nIt is intended for current \u0026 potential gRPC users as well as engineers interested in exploring the benefits of HTTP/3. \n\n   Helm vs. Kustomize: the frenemies that soothe Kubernetes   Ana Maria Mihalceanu  Tools-in-Action | Build \u0026 Deploy   At the beginning of working with Kubernetes, engineers considered it bliss to have a simplified model when dealing with infrastructure. As maintaining infrastructure for distributed systems showed its complex consequences, other means appeared to help tame the marvelous k8s beast. Helm’s arrival became the de facto standard as it was seen as the only real choice to reuse Kubernetes resources until Kubernetes 1.14 was released, having Kustomize embedded in it. \n\nIt is human nature to challenge and debate, and in this talk, we will observe through examples what makes Helmand Kustomizeadversaries in the Kubernetes resource reusability battle, but also when they can even work together.\n\n   How Betclic is using its Datalake to generate some load tests and simulate sports events ?   Etienne Puissant and Jozwiak Nicolas  Tools-in-Action | Architecture   Sports betting is growing a lot since few years in Europ. All actors in the domain are confronted to the same issue : how to ensure a flawless continuity of service whereas systems requests are exponentially increasing ? Climax of the phenomenon, Euro 2020 football excitement.\nTo prepare that event, at Betclic, we developed a platform to generate some load tests in order to replay past events and associated actions (bet placement, offers reading, etc) Based on a datalake which is able to ingest our logs, that solution allows us to simulate a configurable growth (+50 %, + 100%). We propose an architecture presentation about tools we set up and used (AWS Glue, Athena), and also our load tests strategies with Gatling tool. \n   How I built the world’s most efficient deepfake detector with $100   Mathis Hammel  Conference | Mind the Geek   ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com is an ultra-realistic face generator based on neural networks, frequently used by botnets to create realistic fake profiles on the internet.\n\nAt a time when disinformation and manipulation of opinion spread through social networks, it is necessary to be equipped to spot fake identities, especially via their profile pictures which are the hardest elements to fake. During this talk, you will discover a method to detect images generated via ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com, with 100% reliability and even a way to know the exact time the photo was produced.\n\nThe conference will focus on a technical challenge faced during the implementation of one of the attacks, which involves TensorFlow models leveraging features of a customized ElasticSearch instance, on very limited hardware.\n\nDuring this beginner-friendly conference, we'll also cover the basic machine learning concepts needed to make GANs work, and a technique to generate almost undetectable fake faces yourself.\n   How I split a 60 module mono-repo in minutes   Vincent van der Zijden  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   Once upon a time, I had to split up a large mono-repository at one of my customers… again. Like any proper mono-repo, it contained a hellish amount of modules, services and libraries. The repository had so many responsibilities, I suspected it could actually make me coffee when provided with right build arguments. And if that wasn’t bad enough, the client decided they needed the new modules in a different build-tool too.\n\nAt the start, I faced the question that has been tormenting developers since ancient times: do it manually or automate it? Of course I chose the latter (if I liked preforming manual labour I would have chosen an other profession). In this talk I will show you how I have spent 10 days to save 3 days of disgusting manual work. I will demonstrate and share the tools that will allow you too to split-up your own monstrous repositories in a couple of minutes. \nBased on a real-world scenario, I will share my journey of finding “the easiest” solution for quickly breaking up large repositories into separate smaller ones. Using live examples, I will show how you can fork your repo’s git-history on a per-file basis (fast!), how you can write your own Gradle plugin to pull apart you project’s modules + dependencies and rewrite them to Maven and what I have learned from my experiences.d\n   How the right architecture helps you make big changes   Nico Krijnen and Jettro Coenradie  Hands-on Lab | Architecture   You want to move to a different framework, or maybe you have to upgrade that really outdated library, but where do you start? And how do you do that in small steps? This workshop lets you experience how architectures and techniques like hexagonal, vertical slice and domain driven design can help you move through big transformations, while at the same time you increase your code quality!\n\nLike many of us, your codebase is likely not a nice small microservice and you cannot afford to spend months working on a rewrite. Instead you need to take small steps. But small steps and keeping everything working may seem like a daunting approach. During the workshop, you will will get you acquainted with several techniques and the right mindset that will allow you to make big changes in small steps.\n   How to avoid common pitfalls with modern microservices testing   Holly Cummins and Eric Deandrea  Conference | Development Practices   Have you ever wondered why your microservices break in production after all the tests have passed during CI/CD? Have you ever wondered if you’re testing too much or too little? If you want to learn about common pitfalls and how to catch them at build time rather than at runtime, this session is for you!\n\nIn this session we’ll share some common battle scars from our experiences in the field. Additionally, we will introduce the testing pyramid and explain why it is important in helping to continuously deploy microservices independently without fear. We will demonstrate, through a test-driven development approach, how the combination of Pact contract testing combined with Quarkus developer joy can help prevent your microservices from breaking in production.\n   How we build GitHub Copilot   Benjamin Muskalla  Conference | Mind the Geek   GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that puts the collective knowledge of millions of developers right at your fingertips - in your favorite editor or IDE.\nIn this talk, Benny, a core team member behind GitHub Copilot, will demo how Copilot works and discuss the design principles used while creating the project. \n\nWe’ll start by learning about the basics of the machine learning model behind Copilot. Using that as our foundation, we’ll dive into the more practical aspects of developing a tool like Copilot. What does it mean for the engineering team to provide a cohesive, easy-to-use and non-intrusive editor plugin to millions of users? How do we strike the balance between strong engineering practices and unpredictable machine learning models? How do we ensure that the performance and quality of suggestions is at the high level our users expect it to be? How does our deployment pipeline look like? And how do we even test this thing? \n\nLet me take you on a ride how we test Copilot across editor boundaries all the while making sure we suggest exactly the code you did intend to write. Join our flight crew and remember - Don’t fly solo.\n\n\n   Improving your skills with the debugger   Bouke Nijhuis  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   This presentation is about levelling up your debugging game. Most developers only use the proverbial tip of the iceberg when working with the debugger. There is so much more to learn so lets have a look at interesting mechanisms like:\n\n- dropping frames (\"going back in time\")\n- remote debugging (why stay on your local machine?)\n- hot code swapping (faster than redeploying the code)\n- stream debugging (for those hard to debug streams)\n\nThe entire presentation will be in IntelliJ. Some parts are IntelliJ specific, but most parts apply to all IDEs.\n   Introducing Spring Framework 6.0   Stéphane Nicoll and Brian Clozel  Conference | Server Side Java   The next generation of Spring applications is almost here!\nSpring Framework 6.0 brings an exciting new baseline for the entire Spring ecosystem: Java 17, Jakarta EE 9+. This is the foundation for Spring Boot 3.0 and the beginning of new major themes, ranging from AOT/Native to Observability.\n\nDuring this presentation, Stéphane and Brian will cover the main topics of this new release:\nthe new Java 17 and Jakarta EE 9 baselinethe AOT/Native efforts for GraalVM native applications and efficient JVM appsthe Spring Observability initiative and what it means for various components like RestTemplate, web controllers...the new Java interface clients for HTTP and other transportsSupport for RFC 7807 problem detailsand more!   Investigate your ML model's prediction 🔬   Sara EL-ATEIF  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   Investigate your ML model's prediction 🔬(Diabetic Retinopathy diagnosis use case)\n\nPlan:\n1) What is XAI?\n2) Why do we need it?\n3) Some XAI tools and when to use them.\n4) What’s DR? How do we diagnose it?\n5) Build your DR diagnosis model.\n6) Experiments.\n7) Understand your model’s prediction using XAI libraries like GradCAM.\n8) Conclusion and future perspectives.\nPlease note that this presentation will focus more on the explainability part than on model creation.\n\nDescription:\nLearn how to interpret your model's prediction by understanding what you're looking for and using the XAI (i.e. Explainable AI) tools to investigate the areas (for computer vision applications) your model pays attention to, to provide you with the prediction.\n   It is not about being right   Simone Casciaroli  Quickie | People \u0026 Culture   I have moved between individual contributor and a management role three times in my career, and every time I felt that what helped me as an IC was impacting me negatively as a manager. I'll walk you through my last transition to a management role: what aspects made the transition harder and how I did overcome them.\n   Java Collections Puzzlers   Maurice Naftalin and José Paumard  Conference | Java   The Java Collections Framework is the most widely used API – probably in your application too. You use it all the time, but do you really know your way around it? You can be surprised even by common classes like ArrayList and HashMap, let alone by the handling of null values or immutability in lesser-known classes. In this interactive session, we’ll look at some obvious code and its less-than-obvious effect. It’s up to you to guess the outcome! But everything will be explained, and you’ll end up knowing how to avoid pitfalls, both well-known and obscure, in using the Collections Framework. \n\n\n   Java™ 18 \u0026 19. What's new and noteworthy?   Piotr Przybyl  Deep Dive | Java   Hey, there are two major Java versions released every year! We don’t have to wait 3 years or so for new features any more. Isn’t that cool? ;-)\nJava was supposed \"to be slow\". However, Java turns out to evolve so fast, that next releases aren't just version bumps, but might significantly change the rules of the game. That's a good reason to check out what's new in Java.\nTo name a few changes:\nPattern Matching for switch,Record Patterns,Virtual Threads,Calling native stuff,Simple Web server,what's gone and what will be gone,and other stuff.If you find them interesting, let’s dive deep together into new interesting stuff.\n   Java under the Hood of Elasticsearch   Philipp Krenn  BOF | Architecture   Elasticsearch is one of the most widely used Java projects out there. While many people know the REST interface and how to use it, this talk takes a look under the hood and picks up some of the more interesting Java topics there:\nWhy and how Elasticsearch is always bundling the latest JDK with the default binary; also what lessons can be learned from Docker to Java distributions issues.What Java features is Elasticsearch (not) using; also what are the requirements for building / testing and running.While the Java Security Manager served Elasticsearch extremely well for Log4Shell and other security issues, what are the next steps after its deprecation to replace it.Elasticsearch's Gradle setup is a monster but a powerful one — how does it keep the developers productive and what are the most important changes around performance.   JOOQ, Joy of SQL   Kevin Davin  Conference | Server Side Java   What if we take back control over our interactions with our favorite database? Our databases are powerful monster and we underuse them 😓!\n\nWe’ll see with JOOQ how to write standard and advanced queries, with ease and type-safety!\n\nThis presentation is based on a my experience in SQL with PostgreSQL, since the beginning of my career as a software engineer. I described all the state of mind I go through about SQL and what lesson I've learned about it.\n\n   Kafka: a map of traps for the enlightened dev and op   Emmanuel Bernard and Clement Escoffier  Deep Dive | Architecture   While looking simple, Kafka hides a surprising complexity. In this Deep Dive, we will explore a map of Kafka kingdom's traps, monsters, and treasures.\nFirst from the point of view of the **client side app and its developers**: serialization, partitioning in a polyglot world, impact of rebalancing, retry and orders, assignment policy, commits and schema loss, DLQ problems, etc.\nThen from the point of view of the **operations**: how to configure the Kafka cluster, how to validate that it works as expected, which metrics are useful, how are guarantees managed, what’s the impact of sharing resources between a Kafka and… another Kafka.\n\nThis deep dive will make you explore advanced concepts that influence the development of a well-behaving Kafka application. And because we’ve got to go live one day, we will discover how a cloud provider handles its fleet of Kafka at scale. This retrospective comes from the work Clément and Emmanuel did around Kafka libraries development and the management of Kafka in the cloud.\n\nDev traps, ops traps, they will be discovered through a fun and practical focused recipe format.\n   Keep your dependencies in check   Marit van Dijk  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   If log4j, Spring4Shell, etc. have taught us anything, it's that we need to keep our dependencies up to date. But updating our applications can take a lot of time. How do we stay on top of that, while also continuing to deliver business value?\n\nLuckily, there are plenty of tools that can help us with this, from package managers to bots that can automatically create changes on our repositories. Let's go over some of the different options, so we can make informed choices about what's best for us in a particular situation.\n   Let's build together a microfrontends application combining multiple frameworks using Module Federation   Sylvain Dedieu  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   Live coding demo of a Micro-Frontend application gathering modules in Angular, AngularJS, VueJS and React using the Module Federation plugin from Webpack 5.\n\nThe term Micro-Frontends first appeared in ThoughtWorks Technology Radar in late 2016. It extends the concepts of micro-services to the FrontEnd world.\n\nWebpack is an open source bundler modules. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files for use in a browser.\n\nIn its version 5, Webpack brings a new plugin called Module Federation, this one allows to assemble \"remote\" files and modules which are exposed on another machine.\n\nThis plugin opens the door to a new way of making Micro-Frontends applications. It makes it possible to cut, version, patch and deploy its application by \"pieces\", in order to reduce its overall complexity and facilitate its evolutions. The multi-framework aspect makes it easier to migrate technical stacks by removing the constraint of a global migration carried out in one piece.\n\n   Let’s Go Triple Active with Three Clouds and Cilium   Patrycja Wegrzynowicz  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   One cluster and one cloud are not enough to guarantee a highly available resilient architecture. For critical systems, it may be crucial to provide triple active resiliency. But how to achieve this?\n This talk shows a triple active architecture based on a cluster mesh between AWS, GCP, and Azure using Kubernetes and Cilium. In addition to a live demo of a working cluster mesh across three clouds, the talk discusses multi-cloud networking and Cilium as a CNI plugin with meshing capabilities. The talk focuses on an honest review of Cilium based on real-life experience. It contains a deep dive into routing and meshing configuration problems, cloud-specific limitations, as well as detailed Cilium performance results in a multi-cloud environment.\n The summary provides guidelines on architectural patterns and functional use cases for cluster meshes with Cilium, highlighting Cilium strengths and weaknesses.\n    Let's kustomize our manifests with style 🤩!   Kevin Davin  Tools-in-Action | Build \u0026 Deploy   What if we reboot the YAML templating system in K8S world?\n\nCome discover Kustomize, a powerful built-in alternative to manage our YAML and keep our deployment readable and simple to debug. We'll see together how to organise our systems, by environments or by features ❤️.\n\nAt the end of the talk, you'll be able to deploy and distribute your Kubernetes application, manage it and upgrade it with ease, directly from kubectl, kustomize and even kpt!\n   LITTIL step for man, big step for mankind   Eddy Vos  BOF | People \u0026 Culture   LITTIL started as an initiative of Devoxx4Kids Netherlands during the covid period. How can we teach children programming while we are all limited by the covid regulations.\n\nIn this talk we show how we started with LITTIL as a greenfield open source project to bring our IT volunteers in contact with primary schools. Why? We support small Devoxx4Kids days in the classroom.\n\nLet me show you what we build and how we love to let people all over the world use this platform for free. After this talk I hope not only the Netherlands will bring these great Devoxx4Kids days to their schools, but also other countries.\n   Loom is Blooming   Remi Forax and José Paumard  Deep Dive | Java   The Loom project has been under work for several years now. A preview version has been made available in the JDK 19, so we now have a precise idea of what it will bring to the Java platform. We can see the patterns we will be able to use, and the performances it will bring. Our good old Threads, created more than 25 years ago, will see a new kind of lightweight threads. Creating a thread will be easier and much cheaper, allowing the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will be covered in this talk. You will see structured concurrency, reactive and asynchronous programming. You will learn about ExtentLocal, a new way of dealing with ThreadLocal variables, about StructuredExecutor, and about synchronization. A lot of code is shown in this presentation that will show you how Loom can change the way you write your code, the performance gains you may expect, both in your application and for the Java Virtual Machine itself.    Major migrations made easy   Tim te Beek  Tools-in-Action | Java   Conferences love to show you the latest and greatest framework versions and language features. But those new technologies can feel a world away back at work. And it can be hard to justify the time spent to upgrade something that’s not broken, such as JUnit 4.\n\nWhat if you could migrate in mere minutes? With OpenRewrite you can! A collection of fine grained recipes combine to achieve large scale migrations of frameworks and tools related to the JVM. And since it uses an abstract syntax tree, refactorings are guaranteed safe.\n\nUpgrade Spring, Micronaut and Quarkus. Adopt JUnit 5; switch to AssertJ. Replace Log4j with Logback. Fix Checkstyle violations. A world of quick and easy migrations awaits!\n   Mastering Testcontainers   Oleg Šelajev  Conference | Development Practices   Testcontainers libraries are a great way to create a reliable environment for running tests. They provides programmable, lightweight, and disposable containers to give you more confidence in your integration tests. Getting started with Testcontainers is super straightforward, but have you looked into more advanced features to supercharge your test suite?\n\nIn this session, we’ll look deeper at Testcontainers and learn cool things like what’s the best way to debug what happens in a container? How to build more complex topologies of services? What’s the best way to migrate from Docker compose? How can one use Testcontainers for local development in addition to integration tests? And what’s the magical reusable mode everyone is talking about?\n\nWhether you’re a practitioner with solid test coverage or just beginning your journey into writing more reliable software, this session will introduce you to Testcontainers and its pretty cool capabilities!\n   Math Behind Software   Bartłomiej Żyliński  Quickie | Mind the Geek   Be aware: it's mostly theoretical math here!\nBut math is an essential part of our everyday work as software engineers, so it's worth having a closer look at what the math behind software is.\nThis presentation is focused on the concept of vacuous truth and how it can impact our work.\nThe talk opens with an intro on how and where math intersects with software development and moves on to defining vacuous truth exactly and a brief explanation of why calling .allMatch on empty Stream will always return true.\n   Maven, my life is short!   Peter Palaga  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   Have you ever attached a performance profiler to your Maven build? Do you know what are the bottlenecks and possible mitigation strategies? In this talk we’ll guide you through some of those, such as skipping Maven Mojos, using mvnd, a.k.a. Maven Daemon, vertical scaling (a machine with more CPUs and RAM) and incremental builds with GIB. All tricks will be presented along with relevant numbers and we will discuss not only time gains but also costs and trade-offs. Sneak peek: the presenter’s main build went down from 23.5 min to 1 min. \n   Modern frontends with Thymeleaf and htmx   Wim Deblauwe  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   Frontend development is getting more and more complex when using JavaScript frameworks like Angular or React. On top of that, the landscape is also rapidly changing. Developers claim that this is needed to build the highly interactive web experiences we all come to know and like. However, that is not true. This talk will show how you can use the productive combination of Java 17, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and the htmx JavaScript library to build such experiences without writing JavaScript. Adding a few attributes to your HTML will allow you to implement patterns like Click To Edit, Endless Scrolling, Lazy Loading, etc…\n\nYou might think that you need to start your new project with a JavaScript framework because you “might need that interactivity” later. This talk will show that you can use htmx to enhance your web application easily where it makes sense. For the rest of your application, use the simplicity and productivity of server-side rendering.\n\nhtmx is already making great strides in the PHP/Laravel and Python/Django world, it is time for the Java/Spring Boot world to embrace this as well.\n   Monitoring Latencies: How fast is your REST service?   Fabian Stäber  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   Understanding how fast REST services respond is one if the key signals in application performance monitoring.\nHowever, there is no established best practice for monitoring REST service performance. Popular Java metric libraries offer multiple algorithms and representations to choose from, each of which requiring specific trade-offs and targeting specific use cases.\nMoreover, this is an area of active development: The Prometheus community and the OpenTelemetry community are about to finalize the specification of sparse / exponential histograms, which will come with their own strengths and weaknesses.\nIn this talk we will give an overview of the algorithms implemented by the most popular Java metrics libraries, explain the implications on dashboards, SLOs, and alerts, and explore trade-offs.\nAfter the talk you will be able to choose the implementation that fits your use case, and you'll be able to better understand latency data on your monitoring dashboard.\n   “Multi-Player” Enterprise Applications: Why and How to Build a Collaborative UX   Leif Åstrand  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   The sprint planning meeting is about to wrap up when the product owner remembers: \"The customer complained about the stale object exceptions. How hard would it be to see each other's edits in real time before anyone tries to save?\" And they aren’t talking about Google Docs, but a workhorse enterprise application.\n\nJust like that, you find yourself going down a rabbit hole filled with CRDTs (what?), message buses and a perplexed UX designer. It's hard enough for your microservices to deal with eventual consistency, and now your end users might also face something similar. Are you stuck with locking out one user while another one makes changes? Or letting users unintentionally overwrite each others’ edits? \n\nWorry not! I've made peace with the rabbit and I'm here to help you understand why collaboration isn’t just for desktop productivity apps and how to make the essential tradeoffs for both your architecture and your users.\n   NewSQL, the holy grail of databases?   Alexandru-Madalin Ghenea and Marc Cortada Bertomeu  Quickie | Data \u0026 AI   Once upon a time, we only had two types of databases: SQL and NoSQL. Both had advantages and disadvantages, but this allowed us to choose the database that fit our application best. Then one day a challenger appeared: NewSQL. It promises to have the scalability of NoSQL databases as well as the transactional \u0026 consistency capabilities of an SQL database. Come with us on a journey to discover whether or not NewSQL is indeed “the chosen one”.\n   No more John Doe: realistic mock data with mockaroo   Pieter-Jan Drouillon  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   When working on something new, you often have to create fake data. Those attempts usually never exceed the John Doe or test123 level, and that’s fine. If you need more meaningful information, or have to generate data on more than one occasion, then you need a tool - welcome mockaroo!\n\nMockaroo offers a wide range of generators, ranging from IT (domain names, IP addresses, email) over commerce (currencies, IBAN) to miscellaneous (colors, animals, currencies). On top it provides an intuitive UI to get you started. Next to that, you can save your data in common formats.\n\nIn this session, I’ll briefly cover why realistic data is useful. Next I’ll dive into mockaroo and how to create your realistic dataset. While doing so, I’ll provide practical tips based on previous experiences. A short demo consuming this test data as an API will conclude this talk.\n   No more Xmx! - Adaptable Heap Sizing for Containerized Java Applications   Jonathan Joo  Conference | Java   The objective of Adaptable Heap Sizing (AHS) is to simplify configuration and reduce memory-related failures for Java applications in containerized environments.\n\nConfiguration of Java applications, in its current state, is tricky and error-prone; incorrectly-valued flags can have significant performance and cost impact. In practice, the most problematic flag misconfiguration is the maxiumum Java heap size (Xmx). AHS boldly removes the need to manually tune and set a maximum heap size, and instead automatically adjusts Java heap usage based on container limits and container usage. Furthermore, AHS improves the stability of Java applications by significantly reducing the likelihood of memory-related runtime errors, while often reducing memory usage as well.\n   OAUTH 2.1 explained simply (even if you are not a developer) !   Julien Topçu  Conference | Security   It is very difficult today to deploy an application on the web without dealing with OAuth2. Designed to better protect users, this authorization delegation protocol has become a standard in the industry.\n\nHowever, haven't you cried trying to understand the concepts of OAuth2? Let's be honest, this is quite easy to get lost between the different roles and the multitude of flows of this protocol. And its complexity has discouraged more than one! However we can't deliver without it, so we try to setup some OAuth flow and usually... this is really painful.\n\nBut don't worry, whether you have a tech profile or not, this talk will help you to finally understand the intricacies of OAuth simply, including the new version 2.1, using analogies from everyday life!\n   Ode to the mighty Bit   Roy van Rijn  Conference | Mind the Geek   I’ve given talks at software conferences about quantum computing and the amazing properties and possibilities of quantum bits (qubits). However: It is now time to give the regular old binary bit the love that it deserves.\n\nDuring this talk we will dive into bits and booleans, the foundation of modern computing and the building block of your entire career. We’ll look at truth tables, bit masking, bit twiddling, NAND gates, how to store and manipulate data (like floating point numbers) in binary and finally we'll take a look at the powerful concept of boolean satisfiability \u0026 SAT solvers.\n   Optimizing Speed and Scale of Real-Time Analytics Using Apache Pulsar and Apache Pinot   Mary Grygleski and Karin Wolok  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   \nApache Pulsar is a new generation of platform that offers enterprise-grade event streaming and processing capabilities built for today's Cloud Native environment. But what do you do if you want to perform user-facing, ad-hoc, real-time analytics too? That's where Apache Pinot comes in.\n\nApache Pinot is a realtime distributed OLAP datastore, which is used to deliver scalable real time analytics with low latency. It can ingest data from batch data sources (S3, HDFS, Azure Data Lake, Google Cloud Storage) as well as streaming sources such as Pulsar. Pinot is used extensively at LinkedIn and Uber to power many analytical applications such as Who Viewed My Profile, Ad Analytics, Talent Analytics, Uber Eats and many more serving 100k+ queries per second while ingesting 1Million+ events per second.\n\nApache Pulsar's highly performant, distributed, fault-tolerant, real-time publish-subscribe as well as queueing messaging platform that operates seamlessly in a Cloud-Native environment with support for geo-replication, multi-tenancy, data warehouse or data lake integrations, and beyond. It is a tried-and-true platform that has major enterprise customers such as Yahoo, Verizon, GM, Comcast, etc.\n\nBest of all, Apache Pulsar and Apache Pinot together represents a blissful union in the #OSS \"heaven\"!\n\nCome hear the dynamic duo, Mary Grygleski from DataStax, and Karin Wolok, Head of Developer Community at StarTree, on an introduction to both systems and a view of how they work together.\n   ORM, 20 years later   Gavin King  Conference | Server Side Java   Hibernate is the preeminent object/relational mapping solution, and is still immensely popular two decades after it was first introduced to the Java community.\nThe Hibernate team recently had an opportunity to ask what Hibernate got wrong, and what could be done about it. Answers to those questions were realized in Hibernate 6, which marks a significant break with the past.\nSimultaneously, the needs of Quarkus pushed the team to create Hibernate Reactive, the first non-blocking ORM.\nIn this session, Gavin King will talk about Hibernate 6 and Hibernate Reactive, and of his experience returning to the world of data access after a long absence.\n   PGP vs sigstore: the match at Maven Central   Hervé Boutemy  Conference | Security   Did you ever use PGP to sign libraries published to Maven Central? Did you try to check PGP signatures when downloading dependencies, to make sure you are not affected by a Software Supply Chain issue?\nRequired PGP keys management is usually not the best experience developers have…\nThat’s why the sigstore project was introduced recently, promising easy keyless signatures. It started with Docker images signatures, but a lot of effort is put to extend its usage to every package registry, including Maven Central.\nLet’s see how sigstore works and how it is expected to improve not only the signing experience, but also the verification process of artifacts at Maven Central.\n   Portable GraalVM Cloud Native applications with Micronaut®    Graeme Rocher  Conference | Server Side Java   The Micronaut framework® is a modern, JVM-based and full-stack for building modular, easily testable microservice and serverless applications. In this session, the co-creator of the framework Graeme Rocher, will demonstrate how the Micronaut framework makes it easy to build cloud-portable Java-based applications.\n\nFeaturing abstractions over common Cloud services such as Email, Object Storage, Database, Tracing and Metrics. Graeme will demonstrate how you can take the same application and successfully re-deploy the application to multiple cloud providers without being concerned that you are introducing coupling to a particular Cloud.\n\nGraeme will discuss best practises to integrate into your strategies for defining your application build, configuration and code to ensure your application stays Cloud portable in the future, whilst still allowing you to drop down and access Cloud specific APIs and SDKs when necessary. \nThe talk will also demonstrate how you can create optimised builds with GraalVM Native Image that ensure maximum efficiently of your application, whichever Cloud you deploy to.\n   Presentation: Get old, go slow, write code!   Tobias Modig  Conference | People \u0026 Culture   Turning old as a developer is hard. It is hard to stay relevant, hard to keep up with the competition of newcomers and hard to know all of those new frameworks, tools, languages and practices. However, the truth is that we oldies have a big advantage over the younglings.\n\nWe are slow! Slow is good! So whatever you do, don’t put your programming on the shelf just because someone half as old writes code with twice the speed.\n\nInstead of getting frustrated over the pace of the oldies I really believe that we need to take a step back, embrace the skill of being slow and change the developer mindset to understand that the best way to go fast in the long run often is to be “controlled slow” in the short run.\n\nIn this highly interactive talk, I will elaborate on the danger of the traditional “software developer life cycle” (developer - team lead - project leader - manager) and try to show how we instead can make those grey hairs your biggest asset, just by slowing down.\n   Pure Agile: Building a Culture Without Scrum, Kanban and XP   Lemi Orhan Ergin  Conference | People \u0026 Culture   Why do we always estimate the size of tasks? Can't we catch the deadlines without estimating anything? Why do we push the teams to be small? Can't we succeed with big teams? Why do we give status reports every single day in front of a wall? How come many companies build successful products and achieve to be agile without calling themself doing Scrum, Kanban, or XP. Is doing Scrum means being agile? Do Agile Manifesto really explain what agility is? As Allen Holub in his blog, \"Parroting the practices of some framework without knowing why they’re important and what problems those practices solve usually leads to an ineffective and empty faux Agile\". It is time to talk about what agile is without doing Scrum, Kanban, and XP.\n   Quarkus Community BOF   Dimitris Andreadis  BOF | Server Side Java   Quarkus, the Black Swan of Java, is getting more and more popularity for its unbeatable Performance characteristics and the first rate Developer Experience it offers. With more than 630+ contributors to the main project, its rapidly expanding extension ecosystem, and a continuous stream of innovation Quarkus is leading the way in the Kubernetes Native Java Application development space.\n\nCome to this Quarkus Community BOF to discuss the present and future of Quarkus with distinguished members of the Quarkus Development Team.\n   Quarkus, Micronaut and Spring Boot fighting in the Cloud   Yoshio Terada,Julien Dubois and Antonio Goncalves  Hands-on Lab | Server Side Java   On the right corner, Quarkus, goes into his challenge against Micronaut the lightweight champion, and pound-for-pound with Spring Boot the best microservice framework in the world. Who will win the world “Cloud Native Java Runtime” title fight?\n\nIn this 3h long workshop you will bring your own laptop, install all the needed tools and be ready to develop from scratch three microservices: one written with Quarkus, one with Spring Boot and one with Micronaut. Add some business logic, access a database in a reactive and imperative manner, run them on HotSpot, compile them with GraalVM, containerize them with Docker and deploy them to the cloud. Then, add some load testing, scale and monitor them. At the end of this workshop you will know which of these microservices is the most appropriate in terms of performance, resource consumption, and startup time… or maybe you won’t ;o)\n\nFor this workshop you will need to install:\nGitJava 11, Java 17 and GraalVMYour own IDEDocker desktopAn HTTP client (cUrl, wget, Postman)Have a Docker Hub accountHave a GitHub accountHave an Azure account (we will give you some credits)\n   Reality as code - How close are we at generating humans and it's environment   Patrick Debois  Conference | Mind the Geek   I've done my fair share of automating computers and deploying processes. Many things have been said and written and after reading the conference schedule I wasn't sure what to add. Lately, though, I've become intrigued by how computers are automating humans, that is, the creation of photorealistic humans and virtual environments also known as 'synthetic media'.\nI will take you on a tour across lip-synching, face swapping, voice cloning and capturing 3d modelling humans. How close are we at generating humans and what does it mean for our society? From Hollywood VFX over virtual production to AI-generated humans via GAN models and deepfakes, I'd like to explain the topics in a technical engineering way to inspire people in this exciting new field.\n   Reuse old smartphones to monitor 3D prints, with WebRTC, WebSockets and Serverless   Guillaume Laforge  Conference | Mind the Geek   Monitoring my 3D prints in my basement means climbing lots of stairs back and forth! So here’s my story about how I reused an old smartphone to check the status of my prints. I built a small web app that uses WebRTC to exchange video streams between my broadcasting smartphone and viewers, with WebSockets for signaling, and a serverless platform for easily deploying and hosting my containerized app.\n   Revolutionizing Java-Based Applications with GraalVM   Alina Yurenko and Thomas Wuerthinger  Conference | Java   Minimizing resource usage and ensuring scalability are major concerns in cloud deployments. For Java applications, GraalVM Native Image offers a perfect deployment platform for the cloud, enabling fast startup, low memory footprint, and instant performance.Additionally, there is improved performance predictability, simplified packaging, and better scalability. This talk will cover how to take advantage of this new revolutionary way to run Java-based applications including trade-offs and limitations.\n   Serverless machine learning systems with Hopsworks and Github Actions   Jim Dowling  Tools-in-Action | Data \u0026 AI   In this session, we show you how to build an operational prediction service using only Python and free serverless services. The service is called CJSurf and it has a website that shows predictions of wave heights of surfing at a beach in Ireland. It is updated every 6 hours (https://github.com/jimdowling/cjsurf).\n\nA prediction service is an analytical or operational machine learning system that receives new data regularly, manages versioned features and models, produces predictions on a schedule or on-demand, and serves predictions to end users or services. We will show how we built CJSurf with feature pipelines and batch prediction pipelines run in Github Actions, features and models managed by Hopsworks, and a user interface built in Streamlit. In total, there are only 4 Jupyter notebooks and 1 Python program. We will show how the system follows best practice in MLOps with regard to automated testing, versioning, and A/B testing. We hope this session can encourage Data Scientists to consider moving beyond only training models to building prediction services to show the value of our work to stakeholders.\n   Sleeping Peacefully In the Age Of Shells: How Picking the Right Technologies Is Harder Than You Think   Steve Poole and Olimpiu POP  BOF | Security   Log4Shell and SpringShell are just the vulnerabilities that managed to get everybody’s attention, but vulnerabilities that can be as harmful as them are discovered daily. Staying safe requires good tools and sound data. Getting that right can be a challenge\n\nWith real-life examples and up-to-the-minute analysis, this presentation will provide guidance on navigating the threat landscape, explaining how different types of attacks need different defenses and how that translates into specific actions that developers must take to reduce the chance of being compromised. \n\nModern software security means being conscious of the choices made in selecting open-source components, tools, and vendors. This talk will teach you more about the tools, skills, and knowledge needed to be effective as well as show why learning to think critically about open source technologies and commercial tools alike will help reduce those sleepless nights. \n\n\n   Spring + Kotlin = Modern + Reactive + Productive   James Ward and Josh Long  Conference | Server Side Java   The combination of Spring and Kotlin is a winning combo for building modern, reactive, and productive servers. This talk will walk through how Spring \u0026 Kotlin fit together with coroutines, R2DBC, Testcontainers, and Kotlin/JS for the web UI. Come for Kotlin, stay for the ASCII art! \n   Spring Security, demystified   Daniel Garnier-Moiroux  Deep Dive | Security   How I stopped worrying and learned to love security\n\nEnsuring that applications are secure is now high on most \"Deploy to Prod\" checklists. Spring Security is the de-facto standard in the Spring ecosystem, bringing robust security and sensible defaults to web apps. It is flexible enough to fit any use-case, thanks to a myriad of configuration options and innumerable extension points.\n\nNewcomers to Spring Security can feel lost when they step out of the \"Getting Started\" guides and need to fine-tune Spring-Security to their specific use-case. Developers can find themselves frantically copy-pasting from Stack Overflow until it kinda-sorta works.\n\nThis deep-dive aims to demystify Spring Security and provide a useful method for understanding how it works, and where the extension points are. Through numerous live coding examples, you will get familiar with the general architecture, foundational patterns and common abstraction. You will understand how they are used in the library code, and how you can draw inspiration from them.\n   Supercharge your Native Image applications in 5 steps!   Alina Yurenko  Tools-in-Action | Server Side Java   You've probably heard of GraalVM Native Image and how it is great for startup time \u0026 memory consumption, but do you know how to useit to the fullest in practice? In this session we'll look at developing and testing Native Image applications, optimizing their performance, working with metadata, monitoring, and more!\n   TDD and other drugs   Vanessa Formicola  Conference | Development Practices   Do you find testing addictive? or is it one of those things you dread to do?\nIn either case testing practices are likely to be part of your day to day activities, wouldn't it be nice to make it easier and more effective?\nCodebases that have been written with TDD can have up to 90% test code, isn't it a good idea to pay attention to so much code you will have to maintain? This talk is a collection of testing practices identified and experimented during years of work as a developer and a software engineering consultant.\nIt walks through different techniques and approaches and the common pitfall encountered.\n   Teaching in your software team    Pim Otte  Quickie | People \u0026 Culture   In this talk, Pim will explain how to set goals for learning, how to identify which goals could help your team and what concrete actions you could take to help you or your team achieve these goals. You will leave this talk with a good understanding of Bloom’s taxonomy for cognitive learning goals and ideas how to apply them in your daily environment.    Testing a hexagonal architecture, done right   Michel Schudel  Tools-in-Action | Development Practices   Hexagonal, or onion, architectures are perfect for separating domain logic from access to that logic, and resources the logic needs.\nBut how to test such an architecture?\n\nIn this session, you'll see a pragmatic yet robust approach to testing such an architecture, with a live coding demo using a Spring Boot application.\nWe'll find a correct balance between unit tests and IT tests. We'll look at different tools for IT tests, and we'll also take a look at granularity of unit tests: do you *really* need to test every class separately?\n\nAfter this session, you''ll have a better understanding in how to balance unit tests and IT tests for optimal coverage and execution speed.\n   The Current Development / State Of Apache Maven 4.X   Karl Heinz Marbaise  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   Interested participants will learn what is currently going on in the development of Apache Maven 4.X. The goal is to get an Apache Maven version 4.0.0-alpha-1 as a starting point but at the same time not render everything that exists so far unusable. The keyword backwards compatibility has a very big meaning here. One of the questions is, how can such a requirement be met? Part of the solution is the separation into build and consumer POM. Thereby the reasons for the separation will be presented. The presentation will be extended by topics that could possibly break backward compatibility. This will be supplemented by a non-exhaustive list of features that are currently being under development. Furthermore, we will have a look at the project structure of the Apache Maven project, to get an overview of the different areas of the project. It is still to be mentioned that the contents for the lecture are also still supplemented by the most current developments (bleeding edge!).\n\n   The Hacker’s Guide to Kubernetes Security   Patrycja Wegrzynowicz  Conference | Security   Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration platform for automated deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. With more and more applications running in Kubernetes, it is crucial to understand Kubernetes security risks.\n\nThis talk guides you through various security risk of Kubernetes, focusing on OWASP Kubernetes Top 10 list. In live demos, you’ll find out how to exploit a range of past and present CVEs or misconfigurations in your k8s clusters, attacking containers, pods, supply chain, network, or storage. You’ll learn about common mistakes and vulnerabilities along with the best practices for hardening your Kubernetes systems.\n   The Hitchhiker’s Guide to a Great Developer Career   Sven Peters and Helen Scott  Conference | People \u0026 Culture   As developers, our job is to write great code, test code, deploy code, fix code, and even delete code, but nobody told us that there is much more to it if we want to have a great developer career.\nIn this talk, Helen and Sven will share their successes and failures during their 20-year careers to date working for various technology companies. You’ll learn about growing your personal brand (what is it good for?), the trials and tribulations of different roles (so many choices), becoming a manager (or not), mentoring and sponsoring (they are not the same thing), how to care for yourself (prevent burnout), and lots more career advice.\nYou'll hear about their inevitable bumps in the road (or downright failures), as well as their successes. As it turns out, having a great developer career is not all about the technology and the code; it's also about you and the people around you!\n   The Jakarta EE BOF   Edwin Derks and Ivar Grimstad  BOF | Server Side Java   In this BOF, we will go shortly through the status of Jakarta EE, where it came from, and where it goes. You will learn how you can participate in the evolution of Jakarta EE. Look at it as an informal Jakarta EE community gathering where you can meet and interact with many of the Jakarta EE participants in the industry.\n\n   The next generation of Angular Applications   Nicolas FRIZZARIN  Conference | UI \u0026 UX   Angular 14 was released in June 2022, and this version announce that modules will become optional.\n\nOh wouuahhh, until now modules were th basics concepts of an Angular application. The entire architecture of our applications revolved under this concepts. To summary, modules were a central part of Angular application.\n\nSince Angular 14, it's the component that occupy this role. These specifics components are called \"Standalone Components\"\n\nHowever this release brings many other features, all very interesting such as: \ncomposition API by injectiontypes forms and new APIs to manage dynamic forma new way to manage the title of our single page application\nHow will these new features change the way we architect our applications. How to integrate them into our existings applications ? Will the module become deprecated ?\n\nThis talk answer to these questions by explaning all the concepts with exemples.\n   The secret life of PETs   Steven Skone  Quickie | Security   Cloud computing services have become increasingly essential to business and individuals. The move from on-premise servers under the direct ownership of the user or organisation to cloud services provided by third party providers changes the risks to privacy that cloud users are exposed to. These privacy risks can be mitigated by Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs).\n\nThis talk will answer the following questions.\nWhat are PETs and what are the differences between hard and soft PETs?\nWhy you should be using PETs and what PETs to use?\nHow can PETs be used to to amaze your friends and astound your enemies?\n   The State of OpenTelemetry for Java Developers   Philipp Krenn  Conference | Build \u0026 Deploy   OpenTelemetry, or OTel for short, is taking over the observability world to uncover all kinds of performance problems or errors. Let’s look at that hands-on.\nThis talk dives into the background of OTel including the technologies its building on (or replacing). It also takes a look at what auto-instrumentation can and cannot achieve. As well as the latest developments beyond tracing with metrics and the first steps towards logging.\nThis talk also takes a look at different approaches of integration — the Spring ecosystem is wrapping most of OTel into Micrometer while other frameworks are not. What are the pros and cons of these different integrations for the developers.\n   Tournesol: Towards a Collaborative Governance of the Web   Lê Nguyên Hoang  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   COVID disinformation, the Capitol riots and the Ukraine invasion stress the critical role of online propagandas on national security and global peace. \nUnfortunately, today, the web is ruled by a handful of actors which have been shown to either pay too little attention to the dangerous externalities of their activities, or to actively collaborate with dictators to facilitate their control over their populations. \nIn this talk, after stressing the need for alternatives, I will present Tournesol, a proposal for a collaborative governance of information prioritzation on the web. I will also discuss some of numerous technical challenges that must be addressed to make Tournesol secure and trustworthy.\n   Ultra-fast Java Microservices: overcome the pitfalls of data persistence   Otavio Santana and Karina Varela  Hands-on Lab | Development Practices   The persistence mechanism is the heart of most applications and microservices, although architects often happen not to give as much attention to such components. A wrong choice and design, will impact the whole system's functioning, no matter how much you scale up the service. Join this session and learn how to avoid this from happening.\n\nIn this guided lab, you'll learn tips and tricks on creating a healthier app with an increased performance by improving its relation with database persistence. \nFrom a Java perspective, you'll try not only more conventional options like SQL and NoSQL but also some trendy new solutions in the market like MicroStream. You'll also have hands-on experience with this open-source ultrafast in-memory data persistence storage allows queries to be up to 1000x times faster than traditional relational databases.\n   Vapourware: The best software that never was   Anders Norås  Conference | Mind the Geek   We've all had our grand ideas and small side projects, but some people have turned these into huge software projects that never came to be.\n\nIn this talk Anders Norås tells the stories of great software that never got to see the light of day, the stories behind and the people how built it. You will hear the story of the world's greatest web browser - six decades in the making, get to know a music streaming service that could have been the first Spotify and more.\n\nThis is the best software you never got to use.\n   What's in my AI? A Comprehensive Analysis of Datasets Used to Train GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, GPT-NeoX-20B, Megatron-11B, MT-NLG, and Gopher   Alan D. Thompson  Conference | Data \u0026 AI   Pre-trained transformer language models have become a stepping stone towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), with some researchers reporting that AGI may evolve from our current language model technology. While these models are trained on increasingly larger datasets, the documentation of basic metrics including dataset size, dataset token count, and specific details of content is lacking. Notwithstanding proposed standards for documentation of dataset composition and collection, nearly all major research labs have fallen behind in disclosing details of datasets used in model training. The research synthesized here covers the period from 2018 to early 2022, and represents a comprehensive view of all datasets—including major components Wikipedia and Common Crawl—of selected language models from GPT-1 to Gopher.\nhttps://lifearchitect.ai/whats-in-my-ai/\n   What’s new in CDI 4.0 ?   Antoine Sabot-Durand  Conference | Server Side Java   Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection is probably the most underrated specification around. It is the Jakarta EE and MicroProfile corner stone since it provides a standard programming model and a powerful to integrate third party technology in a seamless way.\nNow that major work on CDI 4.0 is nearly over (waiting for Jakarta EE 10 release), it’s interesting to list the evolution of the spec in the last year.\nIn this talk we’ll go thru all new and corrected features in the specification and will make a big focus on CDI lite that will enhance CDI spec to better support build time framework like Quarkus.\nWe’ll go thru the new portable extension API with a concrete example, and we’ll see how it differs from legacy runtime portable extension.\nYou’ll leave the talk being able to develop CDI Lite extension for your favorite framework integrating it to the CDI programming model.\n   What the heck is Project Loom and what can a normal Java developer expect from it?   Deepu K Sasidharan  Conference | Java   You may have heard the words Project Loom, Fibers, Structured concurrency, and Virtual threads from Java enthusiasts. But what exactly are these, and what is the current state of concurrency in Java? can Java keep up with languages like Go and Rust when it comes to fearless concurrency? Let's be honest, concurrency in java is not among the easiest to master, and thread safety is even more difficult to get right. Can Project loom help to make it easier and less idiot-proof? In this session, I'll do a deep dive into Project loom and explain the different features in the work, look at the current state, and compare it with what we have today with some samples. We will also look into it from the aspect of what a normally Java developer can expect/benefit from it. So come join me for an exciting ride.\n   Will Git Be Around Forever? A List of Possible Successors   Hanno Embregts  Tools-in-Action | Mind the Geek   Ten years ago, only Linux kernel committers and other early adopters used Git. Almost everyone else used Subversion. Ten years later, Git is the most popular product. Which makes me wonder: what will we use another ten years from now? And what features would YOU want from your version control software in 2032? No history rewrites? Faster? No merge conflicts ever? \nIn this talk I'll discuss a few post-Git products, including Fossil, Plastic and Pijul, and their support for the features we so dearly desire. I'll also try to predict which one will be 'the top dog' in 2032.\n\nSo attend this session if you're excited about the future of version control and if you want to have a shot at beating even (!) the early adopters. Now if it turns out I was right, remember that you heard it here first. 😀\n   Women's journey in tech   Pooneh Mokariasl  Tools-in-Action | People \u0026 Culture   Tech companies have found out they benefit when their employees are made up of diverse backgrounds, ideas, experiences and visions.\nNowadays, we know fixing the challenge of gender imbalance adds more value to the society in several aspects, we care about it and we knows how important it is.\nThus, the tech companies attempt to change the environment by attracting more women and to make the future of tech more diverse. However, the pool of female candidates is not large enough to compensate for this gap. In addition, we agree that the challenges exist which not only discourage women from joining this field but also from staying in it.\nSo the following questions could lead us through this journey.\nHow is it to work as a woman in the R\u0026D of tech companies?Which aspects could be improved? How do we ensure that more women will be attracted to R\u0026D sector? How we can change society to tackle the diversity imbalance?\nI believe sharing our lived experience as a woman is valuable as it can improve the situation and make the tech environment more diverse than before. By sharing their thoughts, every woman can have a significant role in enhancing the tech environment. Let’s talk about the challenges, and the lived experiences and motivate others to express themselves.\n    Write You An Actor (System) For Great Good! (with JBang, JDK 19, records, pattern matching and virtual threads!)   Edoardo Vacchi  Deep Dive | Java   Learn everything about all the fanciest recent features of the JDK, by implementing an actor system from scratch! \nIn this deep-dive, we will explain how an actor system works, and live-code it right before your eyes using expression switches, records, sealed type hierarchies, and virtual threads! \nWe will compare our actor system to other languages and actor runtimes, and will bring all of this to your fingertips with the power of JBang!\n\n\n   Writing cleaner code with Domain-Driven Design   Paul van der Slot  Conference | Development Practices   I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more. You can expect a talk with a lot of code examples and practical advise that you can use the next day.\n\n   You shall not password    Mark van der Linden and Lucien Immink  Conference | Security   In these modern times of real privacy protection and increased server-side security, a key risk can still be defined as “relying on a single word or phrase to protect all of one’s data”. Consider a password a secret you happily seem to share with the world wide web. Ponder the thought: if you start sharing your secret, can it still be considered a secret?  During this session, iO experts Mark and Lucien take you through a multitude of security measures that don’t rely on the use of passwords. They’ll share the reasons why we should move away from passwords and how you can easily implement Web Authentication to provide your users with a simple and more secure way of authentication. Welcome, to the age of passwordless authentication! In short: FIDO: let’s solve the world’s password problem, together Web Authentication: there once was… a credential management API Authenticators: ‘And who might you be?’ \n   Zero Trust Security for your APIs   Akshata Sawant  Tools-in-Action | Security   Are you a mid-level developer or an architect who’s curious about API Security and how to achieve it? In that case, we’re excited to help!!\nAs you already know APIs are the building blocks of your application network. They are the medium of communication and involve a lot of data transactions. As per Gartner’s report, API abuse will be the most frequent vector attack, and it’s quite evident. We have heard about the API abuses and attacks quite often.\nIn order to protect your APIs and provide complete security we will adopt the Zero Trust Security model. We will learn about the Zero trust model and the architecture. We will also understand how to implement the Zero Trust Security in easy steps.\nBy the end of the presentation you’ll have a fair idea about API Security and how to protect your API ecosystems using Zero Trust Security. Come along with your queries for us! \n\n    ","wordCount":"17558","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-08-18T14:26:12Z","dateModified":"2022-08-20T09:23:58+02:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.pieterjd.be/posts/sneak-preview-devoxxbe-2022-talks/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"pieterjd.be","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.pieterjd.be/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

So let's get this one out of the way: there are only two hard things in Computer Science -&nbsp;cache invalidation and naming things. </p><p><br></p><p>Yes, caching is hard. It looks simple at first glance, which leads to a simplistic design and implementation. The application starts slowing down: introduce some caches. Simple library, simply put, a few gets, simple invalidation logic (or maybe not). Fast forward, and we end up with even worse bottlenecks. Instead of fixing an issue, we've just covered it with yet another layer of mud:&nbsp;stalled data (already invalid) in services which cannot be scaled out (different data lands on different nodes) and traded latency and read-access time for risk of actually losing the data (eventual writes). </p><p><br></p><p>We obviously can do better! In this talk, we will walk through different use-cases (as cache design depends on the use-case) which might require caching. We will look at how caching can be designed and effectively implemented.

In this presentation we show you how records are working, how you can use them to make your code much more readable, and how you can leverage sealed types and switch expressions to improve the modularity of your application.

When deserializing JSON, XML, or YAML, similar issues can occur as well. In this talk, I explain how deserialization vulnerabilities work natively in Java and how attack chains are created. Next, I will show that deserializing XML, JSON, and YAML can also get you into trouble. And of course, we had the recent Log4j problems with deserialization. Many different problems can occur when deserializing data and in this session, I will use several demos to illustrate various security issues. How do you avoid these issues? I will give you some pointers on how to mitigate these problems in your own applications, this also includes new features in Java 17.

Furthermore, to quickly develop and adapt database orchestrations, one must use the tools that offer scalable solutions that are easy to monitor and manage.</p><p>This talk will illustrate how easy it is to automate orchestration workflows with Apache Airflow and CrateDB. Apache Airflow is one of the most popular platforms for programmatically creating, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. The workflows are defined as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where each node in a DAG represents an execution task. Initially, Airflow was designed in a way that each task run independently. As of Airflow 2.3, a dynamic task mapping feature has been introduced, making Airflow a perfect solution for building dynamic workflows.</p><p>On the other hand, CrateDB is an open-source, distributed database that makes storage and analysis of massive amounts of data simple and efficient. CrateDB offers a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and availability. One of CrateDB’s key strengths is its compatibility with many data engineering tools, including Apache Airflow. </p><p>In this talk, you will learn how to set up a new orchestration project, and how to use Airflow with CrateDB to orchestrate complex tasks. </p></td>

The traditional approach to develop & run Java applications included setting up applications servers, complex build & dependency management and often relied on large enterprise frameworks. In contrast, Serverless functions are ideally short-lived, single-purposed and do not rely on extensive infrastructure configuration. This paradigm shift encouraged new frameworks, concepts and techniques to evolve.</p><p><br></p><p>In this workshop you will learn how to bring your traditional Java Spring application to AWS Lambda with minimal effort and iteratively apply optimizations to get the best out of your Serverless Java experience.

<td colspan=3><p>Virtual threads will be very likely the next big game changer in the Java ecosystem, allowing to have the scalability of asynchronous programming models with the simplicity of synchronous code. Their main claim is that, differently from native threads that are a costly and then scarce resource, you can create as many virtual threads as you want with known and much cheaper memory and performance impact than the native ones. But is this always true? What are the costs of scheduling thousands or even millions of virtual threads? Does the more frequent context switch have some performance implications? What about the cache misses that these context switches could potentially imply? During this talk we will try to answer these questions in a funny way, by analyzing an implementation of the traditional Conway's Game of Life based on the communicating sequential processes (CSP) model and using both virtual and native threads with different algorithms in order to compare their performances. Based on this analysis we will also try to derive some rules of thumb on when and how using virtual threads. </p><p><br></p></td>

Creating a thread will be easier and much cheaper, allowing the creation of millions of them in a single JVM. These virtual threads can be block at almost no cost. These new virtual threads bring with them new notions that will be covered in this talk. You will see structured concurrency, reactive and asynchronous programming. You will learn about ExtentLocal, a new way of dealing with ThreadLocal variables, about StructuredExecutor, and about synchronization.

Why do we give status reports every single day in front of a wall? How come many companies build successful products and achieve to be agile without calling themself doing Scrum, Kanban, or XP. Is doing Scrum means being agile? Do Agile Manifesto really explain what agility is? As Allen Holub in his blog, "Parroting the practices of some framework without knowing why they’re important and what problems those practices solve usually leads to an ineffective and empty faux Agile". It is time to talk about what agile is without doing Scrum, Kanban, and XP.</p></td>

Thereby the reasons for the separation will be presented. The presentation will be extended by topics that could possibly break backward compatibility.

Let's be honest, concurrency in java is not among the easiest to master, and thread safety is even more difficult to get right. Can Project loom help to make it easier and less idiot-proof? In this session, I'll do a deep dive into Project loom and explain the different features in the work, look at the current state, and compare it with what we have today with some samples. We will also look into it from the aspect of what a normally Java developer can expect/benefit from it. So come join me for an exciting ride.</p></td>

<td colspan=3><p>Ten years ago, only Linux kernel committers and other early adopters used Git. Almost everyone else used Subversion. Ten years later, Git is the most popular product. Which makes me wonder: what will we use another ten years from now? And what features would YOU want from your version control software in 2032? No history rewrites? Faster? No merge conflicts ever?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>In this talk I'll discuss a few post-Git products, including Fossil, Plastic and Pijul, and their support for the features we so dearly desire. I'll also try to predict which one will be 'the top dog' in 2032.</p><p><br></p><p>So attend this session if you're excited about the future of version control and if you want to have a shot at beating even (!) the early adopters. Now if it turns out I was right, remember that you heard it here first. 😀</p></td>

But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more.
