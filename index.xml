      <title>Moving from Jekyll to Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Jekyll for a few years now. Main reason to use it, is its nice integration with Github Pages. However the frustrations now have outweighted the advantages.
Not so cool What annoyed me tremendously is getting Jekyll to run. All the ruby issues were hard to solve for me.
Next in line is how to structure the content. As long as you only want to blog, Jekyll is good enough.</description>

      <description>As I will be speaking at the Data Science Leuven meetup this Thursday, I&amp;rsquo;m preparing my slidedeck.
To make it visually more attractive, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into color schemes. And this quote was quite interesting:
 Limit yourself to maximum 4 different colors
 In the end I found inspiration from the slideteam website, the &amp;lsquo;Red and Grey&amp;rsquo; color palette.
 Gray : #EFEFEF Darkgray : #7F7F7F Red : #E04556 Darkred : #2B1515  These colors are then combined so there is contrast in the combination.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m currently working for a famous yellow telco with a huge legacy, I recently had to deal with a PHP application. Although there is a PHP dedicated team, we were forced asked to deal with the PHP part as well.
I did have some past experiences with PHP (and to some extend Drupal), so I faced this old dud. Luckily I just needed to spin up a Vagrant box so that was quite easy.</description>

      <title>Custom property naming strategy with Jackson</title>

      <description>For a pet project of mine, I&amp;rsquo;m consuming a REST API. Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s probably not written with Spring (Boot), as the body of requests and response are not according to what you&amp;rsquo;re used to, UpperCamelCase instead of lowerCamelCase.
{&amp;#34;SessionKey&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;7d38ec29-d1f3-42e9-b35f-91b505bf3206&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Status&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;UpdatesComplete&amp;#34; } At first, I thought I could solve it with a @JsonProperty(&amp;quot;...&amp;quot;) annotation on every field, but there are so many of them :o
This can easily be fixed with the property naming class annotation:</description>

      <title>Spring boot without a web container</title>
      <link>http://www.pieterjd.be/posts/2019-07-31-springboot-without-tomcat/</link>

      <description>I really like spring boot a lot - just throw in some dependencies and BAM it&amp;rsquo;s configured right out of the box.
For a pet project of mine, I&amp;rsquo;m consuming a REST API. So I included the spring-boot-starter-web artificact.
Not so surprisingly, the logs showed Tomcat was booting. In this particular project, I don&amp;rsquo;t need tomcat or any other web container for that matter. So how to exclude this?
My first guess was the application properties, but there was nothing to turn the web container on or off.</description>

      <title>How to check if a row with a specific column value exists in Spring Data</title>

      <description>Spring Data has a great declarative way of defining queries, called derived queries. Suppose you have a Person class with an email field. Then you can define the following method in a Repository interface:
public interface PersonRepository extends JpaRepository&amp;lt;Person,Long&amp;gt;{ List&amp;lt;Person&amp;gt; findByEmail(String email); } Spring derives the query based on the method name, in this case a query to retrieve all persons with a given value for the email field.
As you can see, the method returns a List.</description>

      <description>A year ago, In enrolled in the &amp;ldquo;Postgraduate Studies in Big Data &amp;amp; Analytics in Business and Management&amp;rdquo; at KU Leuven. And today, the project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on for the past 3 months came to a conclusion with the final presentation.
The dataset I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on was collected by The Belgian federal police during 2014-2016 and contains over 52K car crashes. It has been enriched by Informatie Vlaanderen with additional information on weather conditions, road conditions and severity of the accident.</description>

      <title>Stream examples Part 3 - Conclusion</title>

      <description>I would like to wrap up with some snippets I use a lot!
Collect to a map When you want to collect to a Map, you need a function for the key and a function for the value.
Suppose you have a list of Person objects with a firstname and last name. If you want to map the firstname to the lastname, you would write something like this:
Map&amp;lt;String, String&amp;gt; firstToLastMap = persons.</description>

      <title>Stream examples Part 2 - Reducers</title>
      <link>http://www.pieterjd.be/posts/2019-04-01-streams-part2-reducers/</link>

      <description>Next to collectors, Streams offer reducers as well. You can consider it as building a result, starting from a partial solution and building on top of that. It is actually comparable to how the result is built up when using recursion.
As an example, let&amp;rsquo;s take the sum of all integers starting from 1 up until n. The trivial solution is 0 for the &amp;lsquo;empty case&amp;rsquo;, this is the value before you start looping.</description>

      <description>Streams are quite fun - in short: it&amp;rsquo;s a different approach to writing loops. Suppose you have a List of Strings and you want to filter out the String starting with an &amp;lsquo;s&amp;rsquo; and put them in a new List.
List&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; sStrings = new ArrayList&amp;lt;&amp;gt;(); for(int i = 0; i &amp;lt; strings.size(); i++){ if(strings.get(i).startsWith(&amp;#39;s&amp;#39;)){ //do something with strings starting with s  sStrings.add(strings.get(i)); } } Although still readable, there is a lot of redundant code: the for loop itself with the counter and condition, the if statement.</description>
