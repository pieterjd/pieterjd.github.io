As I will be speaking at the [Data Science Leuven meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Leuven/events/264310676/) this Thursday, I'm preparing my slidedeck.

To make it visually more attractive, I've been looking into color schemes. And this quote was quite interesting:

> Limit yourself to maximum 4 different colors

In the end I found inspiration from the slideteam website, the ['Red and Grey' color palette](https://www.slideteam.net/color-palette-for-presentation-red-and-grey.html).
* <span style='color: #EFEFEF'>Gray</span> : #EFEFEF
* <span style='color: #7F7F7F'>Darkgray</span> : #7F7F7F
* <span style='color: #E04556'>Red</span> : #E04556
* <span style='color: #2B1515'>Darkred</span> : #2B1515

These colors are then combined so there is contrast in the combination. Below you see a box with blue background and red dotted border for constrast with the used color combination:

<span style="background-color: blue;border-width: 5px;border-color: red;border-style: dashed;">
  <span style='background-color: #EFEFEF;color: #7F7F7F'>Darkgray on gray background</span>
  <span style='background-color: #EFEFEF;color: #E04556'>Red on gray background</span>
  <span style='background-color: #EFEFEF;color: #2B1515'>Darkred on gray background</span>
</span>

It's hard to tell but the colors are a bit softer than in the first list without any background color.
